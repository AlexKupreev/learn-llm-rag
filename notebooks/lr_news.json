    "content": "I\u2019ve been having problems for the last 3 years or so where Mess With DNS periodically runs out of memory and gets OOM killed. This hasn\u2019t been a big priority for me: usually it just goes down for a few minutes while it restarts, and it only happens once a day at most, so I\u2019ve just been ignoring. But last week it started actually causing a problem so I decided to look into it. This was kind of winding road where I learned a lot so here\u2019s a table of contents: there\u2019s about 100MB of memory available I run Mess With DNS on a VM without about 465MB of RAM, which according to ps aux (the RSS column) is split up something like: 100MB for PowerDNS 200MB for Mess With DNS 40MB for hallpass That leaves about 110MB of memory free. A while back I set GOMEMLIMIT to 250MB to try to make sure the garbage collector ran if Mess With DNS used more than 250MB of memory, and I think this helped but it didn\u2019t solve everything. the problem: OOM killing the backup script A few weeks ago I started backing up Mess With DNS\u2019s database for the first time using restic. This has been working okay, but since Mess With DNS operates without much extra memory I think restic sometimes needed more memory than was available on the system, and so the backup script sometimes got OOM killed. This was a problem because backups might be corrupted sometimes more importantly, restic takes out a lock when it runs, and so I\u2019d have to manually do an unlock if I wanted the backups to continue working. Doing manual work like this is the #1 thing I try to avoid with all my web services (who has time for that!) so I really wanted to do something about it. There\u2019s probably more than one solution to this, but I decided to try to make Mess With DNS use less memory so that there was more available memory on the system, mostly because it seemed like a fun problem to try to solve. what\u2019s using memory: IP addresses I\u2019d run a memory profile of Mess With DNS a bunch of times in the past, so I knew exactly what was using most of Mess With DNS\u2019s memory: IP addresses. When it starts, Mess With DNS loads this database where you can look up the ASN of every IP address into memory, so that when it receives a DNS query it can take the source IP address like 74.125.16.248 and tell you that IP address belongs to GOOGLE. This database by itself used about 117MB of memory, and a simple du told me that was too much \u2013 the original text files were only 37MB! $ du -sh *.tsv 26M ip2asn-v4.tsv 11M ip2asn-v6.tsv The way it worked originally is that I had an array of these: type IPRange struct { StartIP net.IP EndIP net.IP Num int Name string Country string } and I searched through it with a binary search to figure out if any of the ranges contained the IP I was looking for. Basically the simplest possible thing and it\u2019s super fast, my machine can do about 9 million lookups per second. attempt 1: use SQLite I\u2019ve been using SQLite recently, so my first thought was \u2013 maybe I can store all of this data on disk in an SQLite database, give the tables an index, and that\u2019ll use less memory. So I: wrote a quick Python script using sqlite-utils to import the TSV files into an SQLite database adjusted my code to select from the database instead This did solve the initial memory goal (after a GC it now hardly used any memory at all because the table was on disk!), though I\u2019m not sure how much GC churn this solution would cause if we needed to do a lot of queries at once. I did a quick memory profile and it seemed to allocate about 1KB of memory per lookup. Let\u2019s talk about the issues I ran into with using SQLite though. problem: how to store IPv6 addresses SQLite doesn\u2019t have support for big integers and IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, so I decided to store them as text. I thought about using BLOB but I didn\u2019t know to compare/search BLOBs in SQLite so TEXT seemed easier. I ended up with this schema: CREATE TABLE ipv4_ranges ( start_ip INTEGER NOT NULL, end_ip INTEGER NOT NULL, asn INTEGER NOT NULL, country TEXT NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE ipv6_ranges ( start_ip TEXT NOT NULL, end_ip TEXT NOT NULL, asn INTEGER, country TEXT, name TEXT ); CREATE INDEX idx_ipv4_ranges_start_ip ON ipv4_ranges (start_ip); CREATE INDEX idx_ipv6_ranges_start_ip ON ipv6_ranges (start_ip); CREATE INDEX idx_ipv4_ranges_end_ip ON ipv4_ranges (end_ip); CREATE INDEX idx_ipv6_ranges_end_ip ON ipv6_ranges (end_ip); Also I learned that Python has an ipaddress module, so I could use ipaddress.ip_address(s).exploded to make sure that the IPv6 addresses were expanded so that a string comparison would compare them properly. problem: it\u2019s 500x slower I ran a quick microbenchmark, something like this. It printed out that it could look up 17,000 IPv6 addresses per second, and similarly for IPv4 addresses. This was pretty discouraging \u2013 being able to look up 17k addresses per section is fine (Mess With DNS does not get a lot of traffic), but I compared it to the original binary search code and the original code ips := []net.IP{} count := 20000 for i := 0; i < count; i++ { // create a random IPv6 address bytes := randomBytes() ip := net.IP(bytes[:]) ips = append(ips, ip) } now := time.Now() success := 0 for _, ip := range ips { _, err := ranges.FindASN(ip) if err == nil { success++ } } fmt.Println(success) elapsed := time.Since(now) fmt.Println(\"number per second\", float64(count)/elapsed.Seconds()) time for EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN I\u2019d never really done an EXPLAIN in sqlite, so I thought it would be a fun opportunity to see what the query plan was doing.",

    "content": "The internet is in the midst of undergoing the biggest change since its inception. It's huge. And there is no going back. The web is changing into the Zero Click Internet, and it will change everything about how you do everything. Zero Click Internet means you'll no longer click on links to find the content you want. In fact, much of the internet already works this way. Editor's Note: Guest author Josh Tyler is an entrepreneur and early internet pioneer, best known as the founder of CinemaBlend and Giant Freakin Robot. He currently serves as the CEO of Walk Big Media. This opinion column was originally posted on X. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter stopped promoting posts with links a few years ago. This forced users on those platforms to post content directly there instead of directing followers to external sites. And now with generative AI in the mix, platforms are even more incentivized to surface content directly, whether it's pulled from their databases or created by AI. This phenomenon isn't entirely new; it began when Google started answering simple queries directly on its search results page. But it's escalated significantly with the rise of AI chatbots and advanced recommendation algorithms. Google is now aggressively scraping content from websites and displaying it directly in search results. What few search results remain are buried so far down the page that almost no one sees or clicks on them anymore. And Google's plan is to bury them even further in coming months. And that's what a Zero Click Internet means. It means an end to users visiting websites, entirely. Instead you'll spend all your time on a small handful of platforms and apps like Google or TikTok and never leave them. The impact this will have, not just on your experience but on the world, will be massive. What a Zero Click Internet means is an end to users visiting websites, entirely. It means an end to digital publishers. The small ones at first. Most of those will be out of business by the end of this year. Then the medium ones will vanish, most likely they will all be gone by spring. Eventually, most of the big publishers will go under. Those that survive will do so by signing contracts with platforms like Google or OpenAI (ChatGPT) to create content specifically for them to scrape. Domain names will no longer have any value, since visiting websites will no longer be a significant portion of most internet traffic. This will spell the end for most domain registrars like GoDaddy and other companies whose entire business revolves around selling domains. The web hosting business will contract as the number of websites in existence shrinks and the number of resources needed to run the remaining ones will decrease. Most smaller hosting companies will likely be out of business by the end of 2025. The independent internet advertising business is also done for. All advertising will be controlled by the major platforms (Google, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, and company already account for over 60% of all online ad spend). Case in point, Google and TikTok don't buy ads from independent networks like Raptive or Playwire (which sell ads on medium-sized websites) because they do it themselves. As publishers vanish, these networks will have no websites to sell ads on, meaning they'll likely be out of business by the end of 2025 as well. The SEO industry is also doomed. SEO becomes meaningless when there are no clicks. Currently, SEO firms can survive the death of the digital publishing industry by focusing on local or niche SEO, but even those areas will eventually be absorbed into the Zero Click environment. And that environment is largely driven by who will pay top dollar to be at the top of a platform's results (Facebook, Google, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), and who is willing to do all their business on that platform. Visibility will be determined by contracts, rendering SEO irrelevant. Each of these industries I've mentioned are multi-billion dollar industries, and none of them will exist as a significant business by the end of 2026. As for users, information will totally vanish. You'll only be able to find information someone has paid to allow you to find. The Zero Click Internet will limit you to the kind of surface-level information you'd once find in a good set of encyclopedias. And the deeper resources you might have once turned to will no longer exist \u2013 except perhaps as fragmented remnants in the mind of an unreliable Large Language Model. And that's what the future looks like, in the now totally inevitable, all encompassing ecosphere of the new Zero Click Internet. This very column is a product of the Zero Click Internet (it was originally published as a thread on X). A year ago, I would have posted it as an article on my website. But if I had done that now, no one would have seen it. That's why the fuss over what's happening with WordPress seems a bit ridiculous. WordPress has no future in a Zero Click Internet. It's irrelevant. And this is just scratching the surface of the impact a Zero Click Internet will have. Own a web design business? Prepare to go out of business. Are you a graphic designer? Hopefully, you work for Google, because otherwise, your future is bleak. It's the end of how things are, and a shift into something else. Whether it's good or bad in the long run remains to be seen, but in the short term, we're going to witness upheaval on a scale few are prepared to handle.",

    "content": "Oops, just like that and six months goes by! Still, there has been steady progress on simplifying the \"Bench Kona\" project down to something that could be transplanted into a car. Smart Key Module A couple of posts ago I wrote about having to wire up my wrecked Hyundai Kona Electric's Smart Key Module in order to get the motor to turn on the bench: The smart key module performs a lot of functions in the car, so wiring it up also meant attaching: The steering wheel with its electronic lock mechanism. A whole second CAN bus, BCAN. This meant spoofing CAN messages sent by the Body Control Module to indicate things such as the doors being closed. Antennas for the short range RFID keyfob transponder system. The \"Engine Start/Stop button\", which also contains the fallback antenna for the keyfob. It adds up: modules connected only to keep the Smart Key Module happy are a substantial portion of the total mess on the bench: Internally, the Smart Key Module also contains two radio systems: a close range RFID-like system which tracks whether a key is present in the vehicle, and a long range 433MHz receiver that receives the signal to remotely lock and unlock the doors when a button is pressed. Ideally, if we're adapting the Kona's electric powertrain into another car then we want to remove the Smart Key Module entirely. Dozens of wires run into the module, but we only need one: the IMMO wire. \"IMMO\" is the immobiliser signal, used to coordinate between the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) and the Smart Key Module. The VCU sends a challenge over this wire, and if the Smart Key Module doesn't provide a valid response then the motor won't turn. Most auto manufacturers implement some version of this. I believe Hyundai's name for the system in the Kona is SMARTRA 4. Although useful for discouraging casual theft, immobilisers are a major barrier for reusing OEM EV powertrains and prolonging their useful lives. The immobiliser protocols aren't documented, and the immobiliser binds otherwise unrelated parts of the vehicle together. This is one reason why many OEM repurposing efforts have focused on completely replacing the circuit board in the motor controller, to bypass all this complexity. They might be onto something, but I still hope to reuse as much of Hyundai's engineering investment as possible... Getting Mobile Turns out, it's not that difficult to provide a valid immobiliser response to the VCU. Although I don't know of any specific reason not to, I'm choosing not to post technical details about the signal at this time. I will note that a class of products called \"immobiliser emulators\" exist in the market. These emulate the immobiliser signal of a particular vehicle. There are legitimate looking websites overseas advertising an immobiliser emulator that's \"plug and play\" on all Hyundai/Kia \"smart key\" systems. At least one product has been on the market since 2019. I believe anyone who reverse engineers the Hyundai IMMO signal is only repeating a discovery that has been well known for at least five years, and that Hyundai must be well aware of by now. Regarding the security implications for Kona owners: emulating only the IMMO signal doesn't appear to be a huge aid for would-be Kona thieves. In a real car, the Smart Key Module is wired into half a dozen modules that would all need to co-operate for the car to drive away. Before the Smart Key module initiates any of those other functions then it would need to see a valid cryptographic response from the RFID transponder inside the car key, and this algorithm appears totally separate from the \"IMMO\" signal. This does beg the question, though: who are these \"immobiliser emulator\" products for? As far as I can figure, the most likely uses on a modern vehicle will be engine swaps and the like - where a swapped ECU may not recognise a new \"Frankensteined\" vehicle to be valid. Here, the goal is to remove all the other systems attached to the Smart Key Module. Emulating the immobiliser signal is perfect for this. Smart Key Module - Out! With the immobiliser signal emulated, all of the modules mentioned at the start of this post could be removed from the bench: Svelte and minimalistic? No... Less overwhelming? Very much so! In the photo above, the Smart Key Module's many functions have been replaced with: A switch to power the IG1 ignition relay, to turn the \"car\" on. A momentary pushbutton to send a 12V \"start\" signal to the VCU, allowing the high voltage battery contactors to close and motor to start. Immobiliser signal emulation. This part turned out simpler and more successful than I ever imagined when starting out. Of course there's still a very long way to go before another car can drive with a Hyundai electric drivetrain swapped in. Charging The next milestone was to verify that the bench Kona can charge. This wasn't too difficult, one additional CAN message needed spoofing as it turns out the missing Integrated Gateway Power Module (IGPM) is responsible for locking and unlocking the charge connector into the port. It provides a \"locked\" signal to the Onboard Charger signalling that it's OK for electrons to start flowing. I don't have any exciting videos, but here's my EVSE charging away: Weirdly, I was able to AC charge from a 15A EVSE without an issue and with no fault codes reported - but only at much reduced charge power (1.1kW, less than 5A). What I saw matches pretty well with the \"Minimum\" charge current setting in the Kona's UI: Is it possible that I left my Kona set to minimum charge current before I tore it apart? D'oh! Taking some additional CAN logs from Oli's intact car, we were able to capture a CAN message that appears to change this setting. Unusually, this isn't a continuously transmitted message ID - the infotainment system seems to send a short burst of this message any",

    "content": "This results in the following transform formulas: ax+cy+e=x\u2032 bx+dy+f=y\u2032 You can define such a 2D matrix using the constructor of the same DOMMatrix object that I used for the 3D transforms. That matrix is then passed to the setTransform method of the object returned from createPattern to transform a pattern in addition to any transforms set on the graphics context. In the general case, a, b, c, d, e, and f must be obtained by solving two sets of three simultaneous equations for the following mapping: You only need to solve for three sets of points because the fourth comes along for the ride. However, in the case where you\u2019re using an entire bitmap or off-screen canvas for your pattern, the mapping simplifies considerably because the source coordinates (at the left) are often zero. In this diagram w is the width of the image and h is the height: Using the upper-left, upper-right, and lower-left points, the simultaneous equations crumble into something almost trivial and you can derive: a=(x\u20321\u2013x\u20320)/w b=(y\u20321\u2013y\u20320)/h c=(x\u20323\u2013x\u20320)/w d=(y\u20323\u2013y\u20320)/h e=x\u20320 f=y\u20320 Another issue is that surfaces in 3D space conceptually have both a front and a back. For the six faces of a die, the front of each face is the outside of the cube and the back is the inside. These images of the die dots must be oriented on the front side. Moreover, only those faces with front sides facing the user (either fully or partially) should be drawn. The orientation of a surface in 3D space is described by something called a surface normal. This is a 3D vector that is orthogonal to the surface; in the case of a face of a cube, the normal points outward from the face. In my simple coordinate system, if the Z coordinate of the normal is positive, then the normal is conceptually pointing out of the screen and the viewer should be able to see that surface. This normal can be easily calculated by the vector cross product. The cross product of two 3D vectors A and B is symbolized as A \u00d7 B. The result is a third vector that is orthogonal to both A and B. For a right-hand coordinate system, the direction of this vector is given by another right-hand rule: Curve the fingers of your right hand to sweep from A to B. The thumb points in the direction of the cross product. The cross product is not commutative. Because I thought I might need some additional vector functions, I defined a Vector3 class in the Vector3.js file. This is not a complete Vector3 class but has some essentials that I use in the blog entry. Here\u2019s the result: Notice that the value of the die is also displayed. The Die3D class that implements this graphic extends the CubeWireFrame class and is defined in the Die3D.js file. The constructor is devoted to creating six canvas objects on which are rendered the six standard faces of a die. Because each of these faces has the same background color, each of these images is outlined in black to make the faces distinct. Otherwise the background of the faces would blend into each other and you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the edges. The Render method loops through the cube vertices and calculates a cross product from the left and top sides. This is a the normal vector pointing out from the face of the surface. The surface is only visible if the Z coordinate of this normal is positive. By keeping track of the maximum Z coordinate, it\u2019s also possible to determine which side is facing towards the viewer. This is displayed as the Die Value. The Render method creates a path based on the 3D transformed vertex points and uses those transformed points to calculate a matrix to transform the pattern as described above. This is truly \u201crudimentary\u201d 3D, as the title of this blog entry indicates. It would be possible to use this same technique to display other types of polyhedra, but only convex polyhedra. If one face partially obscures another face, then rather complex clipping would have to be implemented. Similar problems would arise when displaying multiple overlapping polyhedra. This is stuff that a 3D system like WebGL handles automatically. Also, there\u2019s no perspective. Objects in the background are the same size as objects in the foreground. Perspective in 3D is accomplished through a camera transform, but perspective has the effect of transforming rectangles not to parallelograms but to irregular quadrilaterals, sometimes with infinite dimensions, in which case it would not be possible to define a 2D transform to stretch the patterns to cover the die faces. There\u2019s also no concept of light providing different levels of illumination of the faces of the die. But that\u2019s possible to implement using the surface normals. For example, here\u2019s a dodecahedron whose 12 faces are illuminated based on a hypothetical light source from the upper left: Click the Animate button to see it spin, and for the sides to change shade based on their orientation. This job was facilitated by some code I wrote for my book 3D Programming for Windows: Three-Dimensional Graphics Programming for the Windows Presentation Foundation (Microsoft Press, 2008). In addition to the demonstration programs for the book, I also created a 3D media library, all of which is available in this ZIP file. Unfortunately, many of these demos are standalone XAML files, which no longer run in the browser, and even the WPF EXE files don\u2019t seem to be running properly. But the media library includes definitions of a bunch of primitive 3D objects, including the dodecahedron. In 3D programming, three-dimensional objects are constructed from triangles rather than the squares that I used for the die. Triangles are the simplest form of polygon and are guaranteed to lie entirely on a plane. Each of the pentagonal faces of the dodecahedron is constructed from five triangles that share a point in the center of the pentagon. A collection of such triangles",

    "content": "Thinking JavaScriptI was teaching a JavaScript workshop the other day and one of the attendees asked me a JS brain teaser during the lunch break that really got me thinking. His claim was that he ran across it accidentally, but I'm a bit skeptical; it might just have been an intentional WTF trick! Anyway, I got it wrong the first couple of times I was trying to analyze it, and I had to run the code through a parser then consult the spec (and a JS guru!) to figure out what was going on. Since I learned some things in the process, I figured I'd share it with you. Not that I expect you'll ever intentionally write (or read, hopefully!) code like this, but being able to think more like JavaScript does always help you write better code. The Setup The question posed to me was this: why does this first line \"work\" (compiles/runs) but the second line gives an error? [[]][0]++; []++; The thinking behind this riddle is that [[]][0] should be the same as [], so either both should work or both should fail. My first answer, after thinking about it for a few moments, was that these should both fail, but for different reasons. I was incorrect on several accounts. Indeed, the first one is valid (even if quite silly). I was wrong despite the fact that I was trying to think like JavaScript does. Unfortunately, my thinking was messed up. No matter how much you know, you can still easily realize you don't know stuff. That's exactly why I challenge people to admit: \"You Don't Know JS\"; none of us ever fully knows something as complex as a programming language like JS. We learn some parts, and then learn more, and keep on learning. It's a forever process, not a destination. My Mistakes First, I saw the two ++ operator usages, and my instinct was that these will both fail because the unary postfix ++, like in x++, is mostly equivalent to x = x + 1, which means the x (whatever it is) has to be valid as something that can show up on the left-hand side of an = assignment. Actually, that last part is true, I was right about that, but for the wrong reasons. What I wrongly thought was that x++ is sorta like x = x + 1; in that thinking, []++ being [] = [] + 1 would be invalid. While that definitely looks weird, it's actually quite OK. In ES6, the [] = .. part is valid array destructuring. Thinking of x++ as x = x + 1 is misguided, lazy thinking, and I shouldn't be surprised that it led me astray. Moreover, I was thinking of the first line all wrong, as well. What I thought was, the [[]] is making an array (the outer [ ]), and then the inner [] is trying to be a property access, which means it gets stringified (to \"\"), so it's like [\"\"]. This is nonsense. I dunno why my brain was messed up here. Of course, for the outer [ ] to be an array being accessed, it'd need to be like x[[]] where x is the thing being accessed, not just [[]] by itself. Anyway, thinking all wrong. Silly me. Corrected Thinking Let's start with the easiest correction to thinking. Why is []++ invalid? To get the real answer, we should go to the official source of authority on such topics, the spec! In spec-speak, the ++ in x++ is a type of \"Update Expression\" called the \"Postfix Increment Operator\". It requires the x part to be a valid \"Left-Hand Side Expression\" \u2013 in a loose sense, an expression that is valid on the left-hand side of an =. Actually, the more accurate way to think of it is not left-hand side of an =, but rather, valid target of an assignment. Looking at the list of valid expressions that can be targets of an assignment, we see things like \"Primary Expression\" and \"Member Expression\", among others. If you look into Primary Expression, you find that an \"Array Literal\" (like our []!) is valid, at least from a syntax perspective. So, wait! [] can be a left-hand side expression, and is thus valid to show up next to a ++. Hmmm. Why then does []++ give an error? What you might miss, which I did, is: it's not a SyntaxError at all! It's a runtime error called ReferenceError. Occassionally, I have people ask me about another perplexing \u2013 and totally related! \u2013 result in JS, that this code is valid syntax (but still fails at runtime): 2 = 3; Obviously, a number literal shouldn't be something we can assign to. That makes no sense. But it's not invalid syntax. It's just invalid runtime logic. So what part of the spec makes 2 = 3 fail? The same reason that 2 = 3 fails is the same reason that []++ fails. Both of these operations use an abstract algorithm in the spec called \"PutValue\". Step 3 of this algorithm says: If Type(V) is not Reference, throw a ReferenceError exception. Reference is a special specification type that refers to any kind of expression that represents an area in memory where some value could be assigned. In other words, to be a valid target, you have to be a Reference. Clearly, 2 and [] are not References, so that's why at runtime, you get a ReferenceError; they are not valid assignment targets. But What About...? Don't worry, I haven't forgotten the first line of the snippet, which works. Remember, my thinking was all wrong about it, so I've got some correcting to do. [[]] by itself is not an array access at all. It's just an array value that happens to contain another array value as its only contents. Think of it like this: var a = []; var b = [a]; b; // [[]] See? So now, [[]][0], what is that",

    "content": "For OpenFreeMap, I'm using servers behind Round Robin DNS. In this article, I'm trying to understand how browsers and CDNs select which one to use.Normally, when you are serving a website from a VPS like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, you add a single A record in your DNS provider's control panel.This means that rr-direct.hyperknot.com will serve data from 5.223.46.55.In Round Robin DNS, you specify multiple servers for the same subdomain, like this.This allows you to share the load between multiple servers, as well as to automatically detect which servers are offline and choose the online ones.It's an amazingly simple and elegant solution that avoids using Load Balancers. It's also free, and you can do it on any DNS provider, whereas Load Balancing solutions can get really expensive (even on Cloudflare, which is otherwise very reasonably priced).I became obsessed with how it works. I mean, on the surface, everything is elegant, but how does a browser decide which server to connect to?In theory, there is an RFC 8305 called Happy Eyeballs (also linking to RFC 6724) about how the client should sort addresses before connecting.Now, this is definitely above my experience level, but this section seems like the closest to answering my question:If the client is stateful and has a history of expected round-trip times (RTTs) for the routes to access each address, it SHOULD add a Destination Address Selection rule between rules 8 and 9 that prefers addresses with lower RTTs.So in my understanding, it's basically:Let's see how it works in practice.I created 3 VPSs around the world: one in the US, one in the EU, and one in Singapore. I made 3 proxied and 3 non-proxied A records in Cloudflare.They run nginx with a config like this:server { server_name rr-direct.hyperknot.com rr-cf.hyperknot.com; # this is basically a wildcard block # so /a/b/c will return the same color.png file location / { root /data; rewrite ^ /color.png break; } location /server { alias /etc/hostname; default_type text/plain; } }So they serve a color.png, which is a 1px red/green/blue PNG file, as well as their hostname, which is test-eu/us/sg.I made a HTML test page, which fills a 10x10 grid with random images.The server colors are the following:US - greenEU - blueSG - redImportant: I'm testing from Europe; the EU server is much closer to me than US or especially the SG one. I should be seeing blue boxes!Chrome selects somewhat randomly between all locations, but once selected, it sticks with it. It re-evaluates the selection after a few hours. In this case, it was stuck with SG for hours, even though it is by far the slowest server for me.Also, an interesting behavior on Chrome was when not using HTTP/2: it can sometimes choose randomly between two servers, creating a pattern like this. Here it's choosing between EU and US randomly.Behaves similarly to Chrome, selects a location randomly on startup and then sticks with it. If I restart the browser, it picks a different random location.To my biggest surprise, Safari always selects the closest server correctly. Even if it goes offline for a while, after a few refreshes, it always finds the EU server again!Curl also works correctly. First time it might not, but if you run the command twice, it always corrects to the nearest server.If you have multiple VPSs around the world, try this command via ssh and see which one gets selected:curl https://rr-direct.hyperknot.com/server test-us curl https://rr-direct.hyperknot.com/server test-euCloudflare picks a random location based on your client IP and then sticks with it. (It behaves like client_ip_hash modulo server_num or similar.)As you have seen in the images, the right-side rectangle is always green. On my home IP, no matter what I do, Cloudflare goes to the US server. Curl shows the same.curl https://rr-cf.hyperknot.com/server test-usNow, if I go to my mobile hotspot, it always connects to the EU server.If I log into some VPSes and run the same curl command, I can see this behavior across the world. Every VPS gets connected to a totally random location around the world, but always the same.curl https://rr-cf.hyperknot.com/server test-sgSo what happens when one of the servers is offline? Say I stop the US server:service nginx stopcurl https://rr-direct.hyperknot.com/server test-euAs you can see, all clients correctly detect it and choose an alternative server.Actually, they do this fallback so well that if I turn off the server while they are loading, they correct within < 1 sec! Here is an animation of the 50x50 version of the same grid, on Safari:And what about Cloudflare? As you can see in the screenshots above, Cloudflare does not detect an offline server. It keeps accessing the server it decided for your IP, regardless of whether it's online or offline.If the server is offline, you are served offline. In curl, it returns:curl https://rr-cf.hyperknot.com/server error code: 521I've been trying to understand what this behavior is, and I highly suspect it's a bug in their network. One reference I found in their documentation is this part:Based on this documentation - and by common sense as well - I believe Cloudflare should also behave like browsers and curl do.At the very least, offline servers should be detected.Moreover, it would also be really nice if the server with the lowest latency were selected, like in Safari!I mean, currently, if you have one server in the US and one in New Zealand, exactly 50% of your US users will be served from New Zealand, which makes no sense. Also, for Safari users, it's actually slower compared to not using Cloudflare!There is a HN discussion now, where both the CEO and the CTO of Cloudflare replied!Note 1: I've tried my best to understand articles 1, 2, 3 which Matthew Prince pointed out to me on X. As I understand, they are referring to Cloudflare servers as \"servers\", not users' servers behind A records. Also, I couldn't find anything related to Round Robin DNS.Note 2: If you have any idea how I can keep running this experiment without paying for 3 VPS-es around the world, please comment below. I'd love",

Happy Eyeballs was primarily intended as an IPv6 transition mechanism, to cope better when a server advertises both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses but one of the protocols doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some history before Happy Eyeballs.</p>\n<p>Round Robin DNS started off as a cheap hack in BIND (possibly an early Vixie idea?) around 1990ish I guess. (I don\u2019t think it was documented in the RFCs until much later.) The idea was that when a domain has multiple records, a DNS server cycles round which one appears first in an answer, so the records rotate with each query.</p>\n<p>Back then, and until Happy Eyeballs, a client would get the answer from the DNS server and simply try each record in turn until one worked. The effect of Round Robin DNS was generally a pretty good spread of load across all the addresses. But it was useless for failover, because if one of the addresses stopped working, clients would typically suffer a slow timeout before maybe (if you are lucky) trying another address.</p>\n<p>There was also a period when Round Robin DNS stopped working to spread the load as expected.</p>\n<p>A predecessor of Happy Eyeballs was <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3484\" rel=\"ugc\">default address selection for IPv6</a>. This algorithm is fundamentally misguided and cannot possibly achieve what it sets out to, because it assumes that client devices will somehow magically obtain network topology information. When the algorithm isn\u2019t configured (ie always) it assumes that longest-prefix matching equates to topological closeness, which is often false.</p>\n<p>Anyway, part of this algorithm requires sorting addresses into order of preference, which defeats Round Robin DNS. When implementations of RFC 3484 were deployed, it caused a bunch of stuff to break because load was no longer evenly spread as expected. A sample of links: <a href=\"https://dotat.at/:/?q=rfc+3484\" rel=\"ugc\">https://dotat.at/:/?q=rfc+3484</a></p>\n<p>Happy Eyeballs is <em>much better</em> than the old client connection logic. Strictly speaking, Round Robin DNS is not the same thing, since it\u2019s a feature of DNS servers, whereas Happy Eyeballs is a client feature. Happy Eyeballs would work just as well if the DNS server returns the list of addresses in a fixed order. But even pedantic DNS nerds won\u2019t mind if you refer to multiple address records as \u201cround robin DNS\u201d.</p>\n",

    "content": "Transactions are a key part to many modern databases, relational and non-relational systems alike. At a basic level, transactions allow us to treat a series of operations as a single unit. The reason transactions are so important is because they provide guarantees that developers can then use as assumptions when writing code. This means that there are entire set of concerns that you, the developer, don't need to worry about because the DB guarantees certain behaviors. This greatly simplifies the code and drastically improves its reliability. What are these guarantees? You may already be familiar with the term ACID - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability. From these sets of guarantees, \u201cisolation\u201d tends to be the most confusing, which is a shame because it is also the one where a deeper understanding directly translates to making better design decisions, and more secure SaaS. I'm going to start by explaining what problem transaction isolation is even trying to solve. Then I'll explain the standard isolation levels as they appear in the SQL92 standard and are still mostly used today. Then we'll talk about the problems with SQL92 levels and how Postgres handles isolation and these problems today. Grab some tea and we'll start. Why Transaction Isolation? Let's take the classic transactional scenario, moving money from one bank account to another: BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 789; COMMIT; For reasons that should be obvious to anyone with a bank account, you really really want both updates to happen, or neither. This is what atomicity guarantees - that the entire transaction will either succeed or fail as a single unit. While Atomicity provides important guarantees for a single transaction, Isolation guarantees come into play when you have multiple transactions running concurrently. Suppose we have a scenario where one user ran the transaction above that moves money between accounts, and while that transaction was processing, but before it was committed, someone else ran select balance from accounts where acctnum=12345 . What will this query return? Does it matter if it executed before or after the first update? This is what isolation levels address - how do concurrent transactions and queries affect each other. You can see why isolation can be more complex than atomicity - there are more ways concurrent transactions can interact. So let's look at how the database community approached isolation. Transaction Isolation in SQL 92 Standard Transaction Isolation levels were officially standardized in ANSI SQL 92. The ANSI committee started by defining the logical ideal of isolation. The ideal isolation as they defined it, is that when you have multiple transactions happening at the same time, the resulting state of the DB is one that is possible to achieve by running this set of transactions not concurrently, but sequentially. It doesn't state or mandate any particular order, just that one must exist. This level of isolation is called \u201cSerializable\u201d because it guarantees that a serial ordering of the transactions with the same results exists. It lets you think of the database in terms of atomic transactions happening one after another. Serializable isolation is considered the gold standard in terms of correctness, but why is serializable isolation so great? Because this guarantee greatly simplifies the way you reason about your application and the way you will test it. You have invariants that you need your system to maintain, for example, an account balance can't go below zero. You can then check that each transaction individually maintains these invariants and serializable isolation guarantees that you don't need to worry about all the ways these transactions will interleave when they run in parallel. You can take transactions as entire units (as we did with atomicity) and only reason about the state of the system before and after each transaction. Back in 92, the consensus was that serializability is a great ideal, but not something that can be implemented while still delivering adequate performance (spoiler: they were wrong). Since the ideal was not practical, they settled on suggesting multiple levels of isolation and explaining what can happen in each. The committee came up with a list of weird results you may encounter if you don't have serializability and called these \u201canomalies\u201d. Then they defined the isolation levels in terms of \u201cwhich anomalies can happen at each level\u201d: Isolation LevelDirty ReadsNon-repeatable ReadsPhantom ReadsRead UncommittedPossiblePossiblePossibleRead CommittedNot PossiblePossiblePossibleRepeatable ReadsNot PossibleNot PossiblePossibleSerializableNot PossibleNot PossibleNot Possible This is a practical approach and is useful for developers because it lets us say \u201cI'm okay with some anomalies and I want more speed. Let me go with read committed\u201d. So, as a responsible engineer writing an application with transactions, you should understand the anomalies and make informed decisions. Let's do that! Isolation levels and their anomalies Dirty Reads The lowest level of isolation is read uncommitted. Read uncommitted allows a whole slew of anomalies, including the dreaded 'dirty read'. Dirty reads means reading data that has not yet been committed. Remember that if a transaction is not committed yet, it may never get committed. The user may change their mind, there may be an error, the DB can crash. Here's a simple example, lets say that we have two users who connected to the same database and each doing their work around the same time. In database terminology, the state of each connection is called a session, so we are looking at two concurrent sessions: Session ASession BBEGIN;BEGIN;INSERT INTO accounts (acctnum, balance) values (12345, 100);SELECT * from accounts where acctnum = 12345;ABORT; In isolation level \u201cread uncommitted\u201d, if both these sessions execute concurrently, session B will see an account that does not exist with a balance that does not exist. It looked like it existed, but the transaction was rolled back - which means it never officially existed. If this query is part of a report about the total assets under management for the bank, the report will be incorrect and include non-existing assets.",

Not because I wrote it in Vim (which I did, in Neovim) but because coming into contact with Vim as a freshman likely kickstarted my programming career and gave me programming edge that I otherwise would not have leaving university. I took my first computer science lesson (CS1010) back in 2016 at the National University of Singapore. The professor was teaching us how to write and compile a C program, and for some reason we had to use Vim. I remember thinking it was archaic. You could only move around with arrow keys because the mouse didn\u2019t work. There were a million commands to learn each which did their own little thing. I remember learning that \"dd\" deleted the current line. This software was obviously something that people only used in the past back when everything was more primitive. Imagine my shock when, after class, I Googled about this outdated text editor and saw nothing but universal acclaim for Vim. Stack Overflow, blog posts, everything. It shifted my perspective 180\u00b0 on this editor. I was delighted to find I could run it locally and quickly learnt that you could apply basic customizations to it so that it didn't look like a text editor from the 1990s. A TANGENT: It is crucial that I was running macOS (then OS X). A Computer Science senior laughed when I said I was thinking of getting a Windows laptop for university because Windows supported more programs. He straight up told me that MacBooks were better for programming. I did not realize what he meant at first, but after getting my first MacBook and being exposed to the unix command line environment I finally understood. Thank you, Jeremiah. Your offhand remark likely changed my career, because without the MacBook I would have never used Vim locally (only through SSH-ing into the university's servers), and without Vim I would have never been exposed to the command line environment. I would have stayed a blind Windows user programming exclusively on Java IDEs and never \"getting it\". From there I started using Vim for all my lab exercises, and it was through practicing Vim with these exercises that I found more inadequacies with my Vim setup and the config lines needed to remedy it. I did not read vimtutor. Nor did I do any \"learn Vim now\" exercises to build muscle memory of the shortcuts. I simply started with a basic set of shortcuts (\"i\" to enter insert mode, \"esc\" to enter normal mode, \"hjkl\" to move around) and layered on more as I encountered tedious and repetitive situations that I solved by Googling for and learning more about other vim shortcuts. I would recommend beginners learn Vim this way, instead of all at once. Using Vim exposed me to the command line, and the command line exposed me to a whole host of other programmer-related things. I did not intend on learning shell scripting, but I picked that up by slow osmosis after reading about it a million times from vim-related stackoverflow answers and articles. I read about the grep command for two years without knowing what it did or how to use it before I finally tried it (for those who don't know, grep is like CTRL+F for lines of text). I never took a formal course on unix command line fundamentals, yet simply using Vim day-to-day was enough to make me learn everything I needed to know through effortless, natural progression. So thanks, Vim Without Vim I would have gone through the motions of a computer engineering student and graduated as someone with bad grades. With Vim I still left university as someone with bad grades, but with a passion for programming.",

    "content": "Thoughts on the New Digital FeudalismHow Big Tech and AI are reshaping power structuresThe all seeing eyeThe rise of the tech aristocracyIn today\u2019s digital landscape, we\u2019re witnessing the emergence of a new feudal system. Just as medieval lords controlled vast estates, today\u2019s tech giants dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) industry and large language model (LLM) industries. Only companies with massive resources can afford to develop these technologies, while smaller players become modern-day \u201cdigital peasants,\u201d working within systems they don\u2019t control.This imbalance of power extends beyond AI. Look at Google Play, Apple\u2019s App Store or the gig economy platforms like Uber and DoorDash \u2014 the pattern is the same. The platforms take significant cuts from creators and workers while controlling the entire ecosystem.The Open Source paradoxEven the democratizing promise of open source software hasn\u2019t escaped this pattern. While developers initially maintained control through copyright-based licensing, the rise of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has changed everything. Tech giants can now profit from open source projects without meaningful contribution back to the community. Consider this: some of the most crucial software libraries powering million-dollar tech services were created by unpaid developers working from places like Nebraska, with little financial support.The dangerous concentration of powerBut there\u2019s an even more pressing concern: the unprecedented concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a few tech leaders. Take Elon Musk, for example. His control over Starlink satellites has influenced the course of the war in Ukraine, while his acquisition of Twitter (now X) has reshaped global public discourse, including the US presidential election. Similarly, apps like Tor make crucial decisions about privacy and security that affect billions of people.When code carries ideologyTechnology isn\u2019t neutral \u2014 it embeds the beliefs of its creators. Consider these examples:Winny the file-sharing software challenged traditional copyright systems in JapanBitcoin\u2019s architecture reflects Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s distrust of central banksTor\u2019s absolute privacy stance influences global communication patternsThe ideological principles often embedded in technology include:Zero censorshipComplete privacy and anonymityDeep skepticism of government and corporate powerThe ethical gapWhile these principles often come from good intentions, they\u2019re sometimes being implemented without democratic oversight or balanced consideration of the consequences. When tech leaders and developers embed their personal ideologies into widely used platforms, they shape society without accountability.For example, during the recent economic downturn, many tech companies quickly disbanded their AI ethics teams \u2014 revealing how fragile our safeguards against unchecked technological change really are.Finding balance in a gray worldThe reality is that ethical decisions in technology rarely have clear-cut answers. Traditional systems, such as requiring warrants for surveillance, weren\u2019t perfect but they did provide necessary checks and balances. Today\u2019s tech idealists often push for absolute positions \u2014 such as total complete privacy or zero regulation \u2014 without considering the complex trade-offs involved. On the other hand, moral panics that are not necessarily based on a proper technical understanding often occur.The way forwardWe need a new approach that:1. Recognizes the enormous impact of technology on society2. Establishes democratic oversight of major technology decisions3. Develops \u201cPublic-Interest Technologists\u201d who understand both technical and social implications4. Creates balanced frameworks for addressing competing rights and interestsThe future of our digital society shouldn\u2019t be determined by the ideological views of a few powerful technologists. We need inclusive, democratic decision-making about how much compromise is acceptable in different contexts.",

I constantly have to remind myself of them, sitting on my own shoulder and wagging a finger in my face.Here they are:Test it manually. Even if you wrote and ran automated tests, test it manually at least once before you ask for a review. Record yourself testing it manually. You\u2019ll be surprised by what you find.Think through the edge cases. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to handle them all right away, but you should have an answer to them.Keep your change free of unrelated changes.Make sure that your PR is up-to-date against latest on your main branch.Before you comment on something, read the whole thing.Do the homework before the meeting. You\u2019ll stand out.Understand what problem you\u2019re solving. Knowing why you\u2019re doing something is a requirement to knowing whether you\u2019re actually solving the problem.Accept that sometimes you\u2019ll have to do things that you don\u2019t find interesting or exciting or that don\u2019t bring you joy.

Don\u2019t write \u201cit doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d Give the reader information on what you did, what you expected to happen, what happened. Think about what might be useful to debug this, then put it in the ticket.Bonus points: try to find a minimal set of steps to reproduce before you open a ticket.Read the error messages.Read the manual, the docs, the instructions, the ticket.Be on time.Know why your fix is a fix.Every time you add a test, actually test that it would fail. Yes, literally: go and comment out the code that you think makes the test pass, then run the test, see it fail, comment the code back in, run test again, see it succeed. Only then have you written a test.Do what you said you\u2019ll do. If for some reason you can\u2019t, let the person assuming you\u2019re doing something know about it.Don\u2019t ask for \u201cquick\u201d reviews when you never review other people\u2019s code.Always keep an eye out for bugs.Make it a goal that people want to work with you.",

I don\u2019t actually have any inside information, but it\u2019s fun to speculate, and it gives me an excuse to waffle about multiplier designs, so here we go! MMX x86 doesn\u2019t have explicit SIMD integer operations before MMX, which first showed up in \u2013 no big surprise \u2013 the Pentium MMX. Said Pentium MMX offers exactly three SIMD integer multiply instructions, and all three of them originally took 3 cycles (fully pipelined). The first and most basic one is PMULLW, \u201cpacked multiply low word\u201d, which interprets its two 64-bit MMX register operands as containing four words (which in x86, if you\u2019re not familiar, means 16-bit integers) each. The corresponding lanes in both operands are multiplied and the low 16 bits of the result written to the corresponding lane of the destination. We don\u2019t need to say whether these integers are interpreted as signed or unsigned because for the low 16 bits, it doesn\u2019t matter. In short, it\u2019s a basic element-wise multiply working on 16-bit ints. The second available integer multiply is PMULHW, \u201cpacked multiply high word\u201d. Again, we multiply 16-bit lanes together, which (in general) yields a 32-bit product, and this time, we get the top 16 bits of the result. This time, we need to make up our mind about whether the integers in question are considered signed or unsigned; in this case, it\u2019s signed. A fun fact about \u201chigh multiply\u201d type operations (which exist in a lot of instruction sets) is that there\u2019s no practical way (at least, not that I\u2019m aware of) to compute just those high bits. Getting those high bits right generally means computing the full product (in this case, 32 bits per lane) and then throwing away the bottom half. Therefore, a datapath that can support both types of multiplies will usually end up having a full 16\u00d716->32-bit multiplier, compute all product bits, and then throw half of them away in either case. That brings us to the third and last of the original Pentium MMX\u2019s multiply-type instructions, and the most fun one, which is PMADDWD. I think this originally stands for \u201cpacked multiply and add words to doublewords\u201d. That makes it sound like it\u2019s a multiply-add type operation, but really it\u2019s more like a two-element dot product: in pseudocode, PMADDWD computes result.i32[i] = a.i16[i*2+0] * b.i16[i*2+0] + a.i16[i*2+1] * b.i16[i*2+1]. That is, it still does those same four signed 16\u00d716-bit multiplies we\u2019ve been doing for the other two instructions, but this time with a \u201cuse the whole pig\u201d attitude where the full 32-bit results are most definitely not tossed out. If we can\u2019t return the whole result in a 16-bit operation, well, just pair even and odd pairs of adjacent lanes together and sum across them. Because when we\u2019re summing across pairs of adjacent lanes, we get 32 bits to return the result in, which is perfect (we don\u2019t need to worry about overflow here because the two constituent products were signed; they can\u2019t get too large). Now, this description sounds like we\u2019re still finishing computation of 32-bit results for each of the 16 bit lanes, and then doing a separate 32-bit addition after to combine the two. That\u2019s a possible implementation, but not necessary; this is not a post about how multiplications are implemented (some other time, maybe!), but the gist of it is that multiplier hardware already breaks down N-bit by N-bit multiplies into many smaller multiplications (the \u201cpartial products\u201d) of a N-bit number by a much smaller digit set. The obvious one would be N-bit-1 bit products, which leaves just \u201cx*0\u201d and \u201cx*1\u201d products, but in practice other options are much cheaper. The partial products are then summed together in a kind of reduction tree, and again, there\u2019s slicker ways to do it than just throwing down a whole bunch of fast adders, but the details don\u2019t matter here. What does matter is that you can have either of the even/odd 16-bit multipliers do their normal thing until very close to the end, and then do the \u201ccross-over\u201d and final 32-bit summation very late (again with plenty of hardware reuse compared with the 16-bit result paths). In short, not only does PMADDWD let us use both 32-bit results that we already computed anyway fully, it also doesn\u2019t touch the first 90% of the datapath at all and can be made to share plenty of logic with the regular path for the final 10% too if desired. Which is why it\u2019s fun. SSE The headline item for SSE was SIMD floating point operations (not my subject today), but it also patched a hole in the original MMX design by adding PMULHUW (packed multiply high unsigned word). This one does the multiply unsigned and gives you the high word result. Once again, this is a minor change to the hardware. SSE2 This one added 128-bit integer SIMD whereas MMX was just 64-bit. It did so, in its initial implementations, by adding 128-bit registers, but still used a 64-bit datapath and issuing instructions over two cycles. Not surprisingly, then, all the SSE2 integer multiply instructions (and in fact the vast majority of SSE/SSE2 instructions in general) can be understood as working on independent 64-bit blocks at a time. (AVX/AVX2 would later do the same thing with 128-bit blocks.) It does however add the rather awkward-seeming PMULUDQ (packed multiply unsigned doubleword to quadword), which multiplies two pairs of unsigned 32-bit integers (in bits [31:0] and [95:64] of either source) to give two 64-bit results. And it does so with the same latency as our 16-bit multiplies! Is that a much wider multiplier at work? Turns out, not necessarily! Let\u2019s look at a single 32-bit product a * b, and split a = (a1 * 65536) + a0 and b = (b1 *",

    "content": "Computer file to test antivirus software The EICAR Anti-Virus Test File[1] or EICAR test file is a computer file that was developed by the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) and Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) to test the response of computer antivirus (AV) programs.[2] Instead of using real malware, which could cause real damage, this test file allows people to test anti-virus software without having to use a real computer virus.[3] Anti-virus programmers set the EICAR string as a verified virus, similar to other identified signatures. A compliant virus scanner, when detecting the file, will respond in more or less the same manner as if it found a harmful virus. Not all virus scanners are compliant, and may not detect the file even when they are correctly configured. Neither the way in which the file is detected nor the wording with which it is flagged are standardized, and may differ from the way in which real malware is flagged, but should prevent it from executing as long as it meets the strict specification set by European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research.[4] The use of the EICAR test string can be more versatile than straightforward detection: a file containing the EICAR test string can be compressed or archived, and then the antivirus software can be run to see whether it can detect the test string in the compressed file. Many of the AMTSO Feature Settings Checks[5] are based on the EICAR test string.[5] The file is a text file of between 68 and 128 bytes[6] that is a legitimate .com executable file (plain x86 machine code) that can be run by MS-DOS, some work-alikes, and its successors OS/2 and Windows (except for 64-bit due to 16-bit limitations). The EICAR test file will print \"EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!\" when executed and then will stop. The test string was written by noted anti-virus researchers Padgett Peterson and Paul Ducklin and engineered to consist of ASCII human-readable characters, easily created using a standard computer keyboard.[7] It makes use of self-modifying code to work around technical issues that this constraint imposes on the execution of the test string.[8] The EICAR test string[9] reads[10] X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H* The third character is the capital letter 'O', not the digit zero. According to EICAR's specification the antivirus detects the test file only if it starts with the 68-byte test string and is not more than 128 bytes long. As a result, antiviruses are not expected to raise an alarm on some other document containing the test string.[11] The test file can still be used for some malicious purposes, exploiting the reaction from the antivirus software. For example, a race condition involving symlinks can cause antiviruses to delete themselves.[12] Standard test itemsArtificial intelligenceTelevision (test card) SMPTE color bars EBU colour bars Indian-head test pattern EIA 1956 resolution chart BBC Test Card A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, W, X ETP-1 Philips circle pattern (PM 5538, PM 5540, PM 5544, PM 5644) Snell & Wilcox SW2/SW4 Telefunken FuBK TVE test card UEIT Computer languagesData compression3D computer graphicsMachine learningTypography (filler text)Other",

    "content": "Currently in Rust, there is no efficient and safe way to turn an array of bytes into a structure that corresponds to the array. Changing that was the topic of Jack Wrenn's talk this year at RustConf: \"Safety Goggles for Alchemists\". The goal is to be able to \"transmute\" \u2014 Rust's name for this kind of conversion \u2014 values into arbitrary user-defined types in a safer way. Wrenn justified the approach that the project has taken to accomplish this, and spoke about the future work required to stabilize it. The basic plan is to take the existing unsafe std::mem::transmute() function, which instructs the compiler to reinterpret part of memory as a different type (but requires the programmer to ensure that this is reasonable), and make a safe version that can check the necessary invariants itself. The first part of Wrenn's talk focused on what those invariants are, and how to check them. The first thing to worry about is bit validity \u2014 whether every pattern of bits that can be produced by the input type is also valid for the output type. So, for example, transmuting bool to u8 is valid, because every boolean value is stored as one byte and therefore is also a valid u8. On the other hand, transmuting a u8 to a bool is invalid, because some values of u8 don't correspond to a bool (such as, for example, 17). The next invariant to worry about is alignment. Some types must be aligned to a particular boundary in memory. For example, u16 values must be aligned to even addresses on most platforms. Converting from one type to another is only valid if the storage of the type is aligned to a large enough boundary for values of the target type. Code implementing transmutation in any language would need to worry about bit validity and alignment, but there are also two requirements for safe transmutation that are unique to Rust: lifetimes and safety invariants upheld by constructors. Both of these are related to the way that Rust can validate programmer-specified invariants using the type system. If a transmutation would break Rust's lifetime tracking, it is invalid. But it could also be invalid if it let someone construct a type that does not have a public constructor. For example, many Rust APIs hand out guard objects that do something when they are dropped. If a programmer could transmute a byte array into a MutexGuard for some mutex without locking it, that could cause significant problems. So transmutation should also not be used to create types that uphold safety requirements by having smart constructors. Like what you are reading? Try LWN for free for 1 month, no credit card required. Still \u2014 if the programmer can ensure that these four criteria are met, transmutation can be quite useful. Wrenn gave the example of parsing a UDP packet. In a traditional parser, the programmer would have to copy all of the data in the UDP header at least once in order to move it from the incoming buffer into a structure. But UDP headers were designed to be possible to simply interpret directly as a structure, as long as its fields have the correct sizes. This could let the program parse a packet without any copying whatsoever. So it would be really nice to have safe transmutation. This has prompted the Rust community to produce several crates that provide safe abstractions around transmutation. The two that Wrenn highlighted were bytemuck and zerocopy. He is the co-maintainer of zerocopy, so he chose that crate to \"pick on\". Both of these crates work by adding a marker trait, he explained \u2014 a trait which has no methods, and only exists so that the programmer can write type bounds that specify that a type needs to implement that trait to be used in some function. The trait is unsafe to implement, so implementing it is essentially a promise to zerocopy that the programmer has read the relevant documentation and ensured that the type meets the library's requirement. Then the library itself can include implementations for primitive types, as well as a macro to implement the marker trait for structures where it is safe to do so. This approach works. Google uses it in the networking stack for the Fuchsia operating system, he said. But zerocopy has a \"dirty secret\": it depends on nearly 14,000 lines of subtle unsafe code, Wrenn warned. Worse, most of this code is repeating analyses that the compiler already has to do for other reasons. It would be more useful if this kind of capability came built-in to the compiler. \"Project Safe Transmute\" All of this is what motivated the creation of \"Project Safe Transmute\", Wrenn said. That project is an attempt to bring native support for safe transmutation to the Rust compiler. That effort is based around a particular \"theory of type alchemy\", Wrenn explained. The idea is to track whether all possible values of one type are also possible values of another. For example, a NonZeroU8 can be converted to a u8 without a check, but not vice versa. But determining this kind of relationship automatically is trickier than it might initially appear. Performing the analysis naively, by reasoning in terms of sets of possible values, quickly becomes inefficient. Instead, the compiler models a type as a finite-state machine, Wrenn said. Each field or piece of padding in the type becomes a state, with edges representing valid values. Therefore all values are represented by a path through the machine, and can be worked with using relatively straightforward algorithms, but the representation does not blow up in size as a type gets more complicated. With this theory in place, it was practical to implement this analysis in the compiler. So Wrenn and his collaborators implemented it, resulting in the following trait that is automatically implemented on the fly by the compiler for any two compatible types: unsafe trait TransmuteFrom<Src: ?Sized> { fn transmute(src: Src) -> Dst where Src:",

    "content": "Postgres provides two ways to store a timestamp: TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (or timestamptz). I\u2019ve always recommended using the later, as it alleviates all confusion about time zones. Let\u2019s see why. What is a \u201ctime stamp\u201d? The terms \u201cdate\u201d, \u201ctime\u201d, \u201cdatetime\u201d, \u201ccalendar\u201d, and \u201ctimestamp\u201d can feel interchangeable but the are not. A \u201ctimestamp\u201d is a specific point in time, as measured from a reference time. Right now it is Oct 10, 2024 18:00 in the UK, which is the same timestamp as Oct 10 2024 14:00 in Washington, DC. To be able to compare two timestamps, you have to include some sort of reference time. Thus, \u201cOct 10, 2025 18:00\u201d is not a timestamp, since you don\u2019t know what the reference time is. Time zones are a way to manage these references. They can be confusing, especially when presenting timestamps or storing them in a database. Storing time stamps without time zones Consider this series of SQL statements: db=# create temp table no_tz(recorded_at timestamp); CREATE TABLE db=# insert into no_tz(recorded_at) values (now()); INSERT 0 1 adrpg_development=# select * from no_tz; recorded_at ---------------------------- 2024-10-10 18:03:11.771989 (1 row) The value for recorded_at is a SQL timestamp which does not encode timezone information (and thus, I would argue, is not an actual time stamp). Thus, to interpret this value, there must be some reference. In this case, Postgres uses whatever its currently configured timezone is. While this is often UTC, it is not guaranteed to be UTC. db=# show timezone; TimeZone ---------- UTC (1 row) This value can be changed in many ways. We can change it per session with set session timezone: db=# set session timezone to 'America/New_York'; SET Once we\u2019ve done that, the value in no_tz is, technically, different: db=# select * from no_tz; recorded_at ---------------------------- 2024-10-10 18:03:11.771989 (1 row) Because the SQL timestamp is implicitly in reference to the session or server\u2019s time zone, this value is now technically four hours off, since it\u2019s now being referenced to eastern time, not UTC. This can be solved by storing the referenced time zone. Storing timestamps with time zones Let\u2019s create a new table that stores the time both with and without a timezone: CREATE TEMP TABLE tz_test( with_tz TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, without_tz TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE ); We can see that, by default, the Postgres server I\u2019m running is set to UTC: db=# show timezone; TimeZone ---------- Etc/UTC Now, let\u2019s insert the same timestamp into both fields: INSERT INTO tz_test( with_tz, without_tz ) VALUES ( now(), now() ) ; The same timestamp should be stored: db=# select * from tz_test; with_tz | without_tz ------------------------------+--------------------------- 2024-10-10 18:09:35.11292+00 | 2024-10-10 18:09:35.11292 (1 row) Note the difference in how these values are presented. with_tz is showing us the time zone offset\u2014+00. Let\u2019s change to eastern time and run the query again: db=# set session timezone to 'America/New_York'; SET db=# select * from tz_test; with_tz | without_tz ------------------------------+--------------------------- 2024-10-10 14:09:35.11292-04 | 2024-10-10 18:09:35.11292 (1 row) The value for with_tz is still correct. There\u2019s no way to misinterpret that value. It\u2019s the same timestamp we inserted. without_tz, however, is now wrong or, at best, unclear. Why not Just Always stay in UTC? It\u2019s true that if you are always careful to stay in UTC (or any time zone, really), the values for a TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE will be correct. But, it\u2019s not always easy to do this. You saw already that I changed the session\u2019s timezone. That a basic configuration option can invalidate all your timestamps should give you pause. Imagine an ops person wanting to simplify reporting by changing the server\u2019s time zone to pacific time. If your timestamps are stored without time zones, they are now all wrong. If you had used TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE it wouldn\u2019t matter. Always use TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE There\u2019s really no reason not to do this. If you are a Rails developer, you can make Active Record default to this like so: # config/initializers/postgres.rb require \"active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter\" ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter.datetime_type = :timestamptz This can be extremely helpful if you are setting time zones in your code. It\u2019s not uncommon to temporarily change the time zone to display values to a user in their time zone. If you write a timestamp to the database while doing this, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE will always store the correct value. Note that Postgres also recommends you use TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE.",

    "content": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a popular network protocol for accessing a shell on (remote) systems. Users might not pay enough attention to detail when asked to verify the system\u2019s authenticity on the first connection to a system, thereby risking a network-level security breach. In this article, I will explain how SSHFP DNS records can help mitigate such risks and share the results of our large-scale analysis. At the time of measurement, only 1 in 10,000 domains used SSHFP records and less than 50% used a correct configuration. My colleague and I from Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin conducted some research on the SSHFP record type and its usage and security in early 2022. The resulting paper was presented at CANS 2022 and published soon after. I also provided a little sneak-peak at DNS-OARC 39. All code and data are already public to allow for further research. SSH host key verification Before we dive into our analysis and results, we need to understand what host key verification is and why it is important. When connecting to an SSH for the very first time, the OpenSSH client will ask the user to verify the authenticity of the server as seen in Figure 1. There exists anecdotal evidence that many users just blindly answer \u2018Yes\u2019 without considering potential security risks. A network-based attacker might be able to perform malice-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks leading to credentials leaks or session-hijacking. Figure 1 \u2014 SSH asks the user to verify the authenticity of a server by comparing the host key fingerprint on the first connection. There are multiple methods for the host key fingerprint verification according to the SSH standard (RFC 4251): Manually, by the user Automated, via DNS Automated, via CA Manual process With the manual process, the user needs to compare the server\u2019s host key fingerprint (such as SHA256:jq3V6\u20261dc in Figure 1) against an out-of-band obtained fingerprint. This usually requires contacting the administrator responsible for the server. Furthermore, this approach entails the risk of human error when comparing fingerprints. Automated, via CA RFC 4251 also touches on the possibility of using a certificate authority to verify host key fingerprints. However, this approach requires the deployment of a root-CA key to all user devices and signing all host keys with them. The former might not be achievable or suitable in certain scenarios and we, therefore, disregard this method in our research. Automated, via DNS Another approach that we analysed in more detail is the distribution of the host key fingerprints via a special resource record. This removes any user interaction, potential human error, or presumed configuration of a user\u2019s device because OpenSSH-client can query the DNS and do the comparison. It only requires the administrator to publish a host\u2019s fingerprints as a set of SSHFP records, which can be securely obtained (DNSSEC). If the latter holds, MITM attacks are mitigated, and overall security is improved. SSHFP DNS records RFC 4255 defines the SSHFP\u2019s resource record schema. In representation format it looks like this: SSHFP <KEY-ALGO> <HASH-TYPE> <FINGERPRINT> The KEY-ALGO is a numeral representing the key\u2019s algorithm (Table 1), whereas HASH-TYPE defines the used hash algorithm (Table 2). The fingerprint is the hash\u2019s hexadecimal digest. KEY-ALGOAlgorithm0reserved1RSA2DSA3ECDSA4ED255195unassigned6ED448Table 1 \u2014 Values for the SSHFP KEY-ALGO field. HASH-TYPEAlgorithm0reserved1SHA12SHA256Table 2 \u2014 Values for the SSHFP HASH-TYPE field. In the real world, the records will look like this: $ dig SSHFP someserver.tld +noall +answer ; <<>> DiG 9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-26.P2.el7_9.10 <<>> SSHFP someserver.tld +noall +answer ;; global options: +cmd someserver.tld. 3600 IN SSHFP 1 1 09F6A01D2175742B257C6B98B7C72C44C4040683 someserver.tld. 3600 IN SSHFP 1 2 4158F281921260B0205508121C6F5CEE879E15F22BDBC319EF2AE9FD 308DB3BE someserver.tld. 3600 IN SSHFP 3 1 91CAC088707D2C61D2F0FDA132D6F13CAE57BCD3 someserver.tld. 3600 IN SSHFP 3 2 65564C015FCA69E82E9B9CEF35380955720C2345E660C39176782E67 06E7FDD0 someserver.tld. 3600 IN SSHFP 4 1 F416A804701190D53B31C5A1EFC2F09104C6391B someserver.tld. 3600 IN SSHFP 4 2 C6DE2110F23A123691D49E94EA71DC18BD6F7277D7A7F9FC2E76F423 89DCAB70 As can be seen in the listing, someserver.tld has three different keys (RSA, ECDSA, ED25519) and a SHA1/SHA256 fingerprint for each of them. These records can also easily be generated using OpenSSH\u2019s built-in tools: $ ssh-keyscan -D someserver.tld ; someserver.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3 someserver.tld IN SSHFP 1 1 09f6a01d2175742b257c6b98b7c72c44c4040683 someserver.tld IN SSHFP 1 2 4158f281921260b0205508121c6f5cee879e15f22bdbc319ef2ae9fd308db3be ; someserver.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3 someserver.tld IN SSHFP 3 1 91cac088707d2c61d2f0fda132d6f13cae57bcd3 someserver.tld IN SSHFP 3 2 65564c015fca69e82e9b9cef35380955720c2345e660c39176782e6706e7fdd0 ; someserver.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3 someserver.tld IN SSHFP 4 1 f416a804701190d53b31c5a1efc2f09104c6391b someserver.tld IN SSHFP 4 2 c6de2110f23a123691d49e94ea71dc18bd6f7277d7a7f9fc2e76f42389dcab70 ; someserver.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3 ; someserver.tld:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3 So, we believe that deploying host key verification fingerprints in the DNS is almost trivial. Also, an update is only required should the host keys change. However, the SSHFP records must reach the client in a secure fashion, otherwise, the MITM could happen on the DNS instead of the SSH layer. Finally, OpenSSH-client needs to be told to use DNS for fingerprint verification using the -o VerifyHostKeyDNS=yes option. Although this feature has been implemented in OpenSSH for many years, it is unfortunately still not enabled by default. The debug output tells us what will happen in the background: $ ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o VerifyHostKeyDNS=yes -v someserver.tld g 2>&1 [...] debug1: Connecting to someserver.tld [IP.IP.IP.IP] port 22. debug1: Connection established.

It confirms that the fingerprints are secure and matching, thus continuing with the connection. Large-scale analysis In order to measure the prevalence of SSHFP records on the Internet, we first built a measurement system that works as follows: Query a domain for SSHFP records. If SSHFP records exist, query the domain for their A records. If A records exist, try to obtain the server-side host key fingerprints using ssh-keyscan. Compare SSHFP fingerprints and server-side fingerprints to find (mis)matches. If matches exist, repeat the SSHFP query, but with a DNSSEC-validating resolver. We ran this analysis on two different sets of domains: Tranco 1M domain",

    "content": "During a recent visit to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), I mentioned a trend that piqued their interest: Over the last 10 years of applying automated reasoning at Amazon Web Services (AWS), we\u2019ve found that formally verified code is often more performant than the unverified code it replaces. The reason is that the bug fixes we make during the process of formal verification often positively impact the code\u2019s runtime. Automated reasoning also gives our builders confidence to explore additional optimizations that improve system performance even further. We\u2019ve found that formally verified code is easier to update, modify, and operate, leading to fewer late-night log analysis and debugging sessions. In this post, I\u2019ll share three examples that came up during my discussions with DARPA. Automated reasoning: The basics At AWS, we strive to build services that are simple and intuitive for our customers. Underneath that simplicity lie vast, complex distributed systems that process billions of requests every second. Verifying the correctness of these complex systems is a significant challenge. Our production services are in a constant state of evolution as we introduce new features, redesign components, enhance security, and optimize performance. Many of these changes are complex themselves, and must be made without impacting the security or resilience of AWS or our customers. Design reviews, code audits, stress testing, and fault injection are all invaluable tools we use regularly, and always will. However, we\u2019ve found that we need to supplement these techniques in order to confirm correctness in many cases. Subtle bugs can still escape detection, particularly in large-scale, fault-tolerant architectures. And some issues might even be rooted in the original system design, rather than implementation flaws. As our services have grown in scale and complexity, we\u2019ve had to supplement traditional testing approaches with more powerful techniques based on math and logic. This is where the branch of artificial intelligence (AI) called automated reasoning comes into play. While traditional testing focuses on validating system behavior under specific scenarios, automated reasoning aims to use logic to verify system behavior under any possible scenario. In even a moderately complex system, it would take an intractably large amount of time to reproduce every combination of possible states and parameters that may occur. With automated reasoning, it\u2019s possible to achieve the same effect quickly and efficiently by computing a logical proof of the correctness of the system. Using automated reasoning requires our builders to have a different mindset. Instead of trying to think about all possible input scenarios and how they might go wrong, we define how the system should work and identify the conditions that must be met in order for it to behave correctly. Then we can verify that those conditions are true by using mathematical proof. In other words, we can verify that the system is correct. Automated reasoning views a system\u2019s specification and implementation in mathematics, then applies algorithmic approaches to verify that the mathematical representation of the system satisfies the specification. By encoding our systems as mathematical systems and reasoning about them using formal logic, automated reasoning allows us to efficiently and authoritatively answer critical questions about the systems\u2019 future behavior. What can the system do? What will it do? What can it never do? Automated reasoning can help answer these questions for even the most complex, large-scale, and potentially unbounded systems\u2014scenarios that are impossible to exhaustively validate through traditional testing alone. Does automated reasoning allow us to achieve perfection? No, because it still depends on certain assumptions about the correct behavior of the components of a system and the relationship between the system and the model of its environment. For example, the model of a system might incorrectly assume that underlying components such as compilers and processors don\u2019t have any bugs (although it is possible to formally verify those components as well). That said, automated reasoning allows us to achieve higher confidence in correctness than is possible by using traditional software development and testing methods. Faster development Automated reasoning is not just for mathematicians and scientists. Our Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) engineers use automated reasoning every day to prevent bugs. Behind the simple interface of S3 is one of the world\u2019s largest and most complex distributed systems, holding 400 trillion objects, exabytes of data, and regularly processing over 150 million requests per second. S3 is composed of many subsystems that are distributed systems in their own right, many consisting of tens of thousands of machines. New features are being added all the time, while S3 is under heavy use by our customers. A key component of S3 is the S3 index subsystem, an object metadata store that enables fast data lookups. This component contains a very large, complex data structure and intricate, optimized algorithms. Because the algorithms are difficult for humans to get right at S3 scale, and because we can\u2019t afford errors in S3 lookups, we made new improvements on a cadence of about once per quarter, due to the extreme care and extensive testing required to confidently make a change. S3 is a well-built and well-tested system built on 15 years of experience. However, there was a bug in the S3 index subsystem for which we couldn\u2019t determine the root cause for some time. The system was able to automatically recover from the exception, so its presence didn\u2019t impact the behavior of the system. Still, we were not satisfied. Why was this bug around so long? Distributed systems like S3 have a large number of components, each with their own corner cases, and a number of corner cases happen at the same time. In the case of S3, which has over 300 microservices, the number of potential combinations of these corner cases is enormous. It\u2019s not possible for developers to think through each of these corner cases, even when they have evidence the bug exists and ideas about its root cause\u2014never mind all of the possible combinations of corner cases. This complexity drove us to look at how we could use automated reasoning",

Oct 27, 2024 Tags: devblog, programming, rust, security This is an announcement for zizmor, a new tool for finding security issues in GitHub Actions setups. You can run it on one or more workflow definitions, and it\u2019ll emit cargo-style diagnostics, SARIF, or JSON as you please. To get started with zizmor, you can install it via cargo: 1 2 3 4 5 # directly from crates.io cargo install zizmor # use the latest unstable from github cargo install --git https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor \u2026and use it by pointing it at a workflow or on-disk repo: 1 2 3 4 5 # audit one workflow zizmor ./path/to/my/repo/.github/workflows/ci.yml # audit the entire repo zizmor ./path/to/my/repo With this initial release, zizmor can detect a handful of common security issues in Github Actions workflows. A sampling of these: Attacker controlled template injection: \u201cArtiPACKED\u201d style credential persistence and disclosure: Known vulnerabilities in third-party actions: These are just a subset of zizmor\u2019s current audits, and more are planned as well. The rest of this post is dedicated to some of zizmor\u2019s background context, and some high-level implementation details on how it was built. Read on if that interests you, or go to zizmor\u2019s README to get started with using it! Background CI/CD security (and GitHub Actions in particular) has been a personal interest of mine for a while now, primarily because of how universal and critical it\u2019s become. GitHub Actions is widely adopted by the OSS community for everything from regular testing to release management and deployment, meaning that even small errors (or bad defaults) in workflow definitions can be as catastrophic as \u201ctraditional\u201d security bugs within the project itself. Despite its central and critical position in the world\u2019s software stack, GitHub Actions\u2019 default security posture could fairly (in my opinion) be fairly described as lackluster: There are numerous inherently unsafe workflow triggers, like pull_request_target and workflow_call, which users consistently use insecurely (e.g. by running attacker-controlled code in the context of the parent repo, giving the attacker access to the parent repo\u2019s default credential and secrets). GitHub could disable new workflows that use these triggers by default and only enable them after a user has clicked though a \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing\u201d box, but such a feature hasn\u2019t materialized. GitHub Actions has a powerful expressions language, which is fantastic for munging inputs, handling basic conditions, or accessing contextual information about the workflow itself. Unfortunately, this expression language isn\u2019t aware of (and can\u2019t be made aware of) the code-data distinction in YAML workflow definitions, meaning that it\u2019s the ideal vector for attacker-controlled code injection: 1 2 3 4 5 steps: - name: vulnerable # oops: attacker controls context expansion, allowing ACE run: | echo \"issue created: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}\" GitHub itself has architectural constraints that result in unintuitively insecure workflow configurations that an attacker can exploit to maintain stealth. The following step definition, for example, looks like a legitimate hash-pin of the official actions/checkout action, but it actually runs arbitrary attacker-controlled code: 1 2 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@c7d749a2d57b4b375d1ebcd17cfbfb60c676f18e Why? Because, despite the actions/checkout slug, c7d749a2d... is actually a commit on a fork of actions/checkout. This is because GitHub represents a repo and its forks as a single network of commit refs, meaning that distinctions between different repos within the network are largely a presentation concern, not a validation one. At the same time, I\u2019m a very big fan of GitHub Actions (and putting more things into CI/CD, more generally): I think automatic and auditable release procedures are the future of package publishing, and that machine identities derived from CI/CD workflows are about as close as we\u2019re ever going to get to a general purpose identity foundation for solving large-scale \u201csupply-chain\u201d type problems. But to make progress there, we need CI/CD systems (and GitHub Actions in particular) to be a strong and secure foundation. zizmor is my attempt to chip away at that problem. Implementation details Under the hood, zizmor is really 3 separate components: github-actions-models: a library of high-fidelity data models for GitHub Actions, which I released earlier this year. yamlpath: another standalone crate released earlier, this one for converting \u201csymbolic\u201d YAML locations (of the kind produced by analyzing github-actions-models\u2019s results) back into concrete source code spans, without disturbing comments or other user-controlled formatting. This is what allows zizmor to produce cargo-style diagnostics (and SARIF results) that correspond byte-for-byte to the original YAML input. zizmor itself, which includes audit scaffolding, helpers for interacting with GitHub\u2019s APIs, an parser for expressions, and the individual audit definitions (such as impostor_commit.rs). This architecture allows zizmor\u2019s audits to be written over Rust-level models (like github_actions_models::workflow::job::Step), without worrying about relating the results back to however the user chose to express them in YAML \u2014 yamlpath takes care of all of the edge cases there. Each audit (defined as a WorkflowAudit) is also independent of all other audits, meaning that new audits can be added rapidly with minimal interdependencies. The audit boilerplate itself is also pretty small. For example, the HardcodedContainerCredentials audit is a little over 100 lines, including all imports. zizmor has partial internal API documentation as well, which you can view by cloning the repository and running cargo doc --open. There are no current plans for exposing an importable Rust API, although that could change in the future. Next steps This is an early release of zizmor: there will be bugs, including false positives and negatives. My hope is that more eyeballs will surface these, and allow zizmor to dial in the right sensitivity level for \u201ccan run automatically in CI on every commit without driving me crazy.\u201d Some concrete things that will be happening in the next few weeks-to-months, as part of a road to stabilization: Fleshed-out user- and developer-level docs, probably in the form of a website built from the existing Markdown docs. More audits. There are a lot of things that zizmor could audit for but doesn\u2019t yet, like common cache poisoning patterns or YAML type flubs . More complex analyses. zizmor doesn\u2019t yet do dataflow",

    "content": "A comparison of Rust\u2019s borrow checker to the one in C# Wait, C# has a borrow checker? Behold: the classic example of rust\u2019s zero-cost memory safety\u2026 // error[E0597]: `shortlived` does not live long enough let longlived = 12; let mut plonglived = &longlived; { let shortlived = 13; plonglived = &shortlived; } *plonglived; \u2026ported to C#: // error CS8374: Cannot ref-assign 'shortlived' to 'plonglived' because // 'shortlived' has a narrower escape scope than 'plonglived' var longlived = 12; ref var plonglived = ref longlived; { var shortlived = 13; plonglived = ref shortlived; } _ = plonglived; OK, so C# doesn\u2019t share the Rust concept of \u201cborrowing,\u201d so it wouldn\u2019t technically be correct to call this \u201cborrow checking,\u201d but in practice when people talk about \u201cRust\u2019s borrow checker\u201d they\u2019re talking about all of the static analysis Rust does to ensure memory safety, for which I think this qualifies. When I first saw this feature in C# (and also Spans, ref structs, and stackalloc), I was blown away: where are all the angle brackets and apostrophes? How is it possible that I can write efficient and provably-safe code in C# without a degree in type theory? In this document I hope to briefly summarize my understanding of memory safety in C#, make direct comparisons between C# constructs and the corresponding Rust ones, and maybe shed some light on what trade-offs C# made exactly to get this so user-friendly. A brief history of C# ref safety Since the beginning (2000-ish), C# has had the ref keyword for parameters passed into a function by reference, but that was about all you could do with it. If you wanted to do efficient things with stack-allocated memory and indirection, you would generally use the \u201cunsafe\u201d portions of the language, or call out to C++. It wasn\u2019t until 2017 with the release of C# version 7 that we started to see this feature generalized into something more useful. From there, C# added: ref local variables ref returns safe stackalloc initializers readonly struct and ref struct in parameters (and later ref readonly parameters) conditional ref expressions extensions to stackalloc ref fields In the process of adding the above features, C# needed to define rules around ref usage that would continue to ensure memory safety. The language specification calls these rules \u201cref safe contexts\u201d (see here and here). A \u201cref safe context\u201d is likely better-known to Rust programmers as a lifetime, the region of source text in which it is valid to access/use a reference. A comparison of ref safe contexts and lifetimes Like in Rust, it is not possible in C# to explicitly declare the lifetime of a value. Unlike in rust, it is also not possible in C# to assign a name to a lifetime using generic type parameters. In both languages, the correct usage of a function must be knowable given only its declaration, and not require analysis of its body. In Rust, this means that lifetimes must appear in the function declaration: // V name the lifetime using generic type parameter // V --------- V reference named lifetime in parameter and return types fn return_reference<'a>(r: &'a i32) -> &'a i32 { r // <-- compiler makes sure we return what we claim to in the signature } C# has no syntax for this. Nevertheless, the equivalent code still compiles: // No lifetimes! ref int ReturnReference(ref int r){ return ref r; } The C# compiler simply assumes that the lifetime of the return is the same as the lifetime of the parameter. Rust can do the same\u2026 // No lifetimes! fn return_reference(r: &i32) -> &i32 { r } \u2026and calls this feature lifetime elision. In Rust, lifetime elision is optional, and the programmer can always explicitly state the lifetimes of all references. In C#, by contrast, the compiler must decide the lifetimes for all function declarations. For example, the following Rust function returns only one of its two arguments: // V---V Two lifetimes for our two parameters // V------------------------V Return lifetime is the same as that of // the first parameter // V Second parameter lifetime is unused fn return_reference<'a, 'b>(r: &'a i32, r2: &'b i32) -> &'a i32{ r // <-- compiler would not allow us to return r2 here } Lifetime elision is not implemented for functions of this form, since there doesn\u2019t seem to be a reasonable default to pick. Nevertheless, C# must pick one: // No lifetimes! Wait. What are they, though? ref int ReturnReference(ref int r, ref int r2){ return ref r; } Since it wouldn\u2019t make sense to \u201cpick\u201d either r or r2 for the lifetime of the return, C# conservatively assumes that the return could be either of them. Thus, both the arguments and the return are assumed to have the same lifetime, which the specification calls \u201ccaller-context.\u201d The equivalent Rust function would look like this: // V only one lifetime, called \"caller-context\" fn return_reference<'cc>(r: &'cc i32, r2: &'cc i32) -> &'cc i32{ r // <-- compiler allows us to return either r or r2 } This is less useful than the original Rust function. For example, the following code will compile successfully with the first declaration, but not with the second: fn wrapper(r: &i32) -> &i32{ let i = 12; return_reference(r, &i) // error[E0515]: cannot return value referencing local variable `i` } and in C#: ref int Wrapper(ref int r){ var i = 12; // Cannot use a result of 'Program.ReturnReference(ref int, ref int)' // in this context because it may expose variables referenced by // parameter 'r2' outside of their declaration scope return ref ReturnReference(ref r, ref i); } Here we see C#\u2019s first trade-off: lifetimes are less explicit, but also less powerful. The defaults can also be unintuitive: say we wanted to write a method on a struct which returns a reference to one of the struct\u2019s members. In rust, this is simple: struct Foo { member: i32 } impl Foo { fn get_member<'a, 'b>(&'a self, unused: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 { &self.member //",

Another way to put it, if you\u2019re using a managed language, you\u2019re paying up-front to have a lot of decisions made for you, and many of those decisions are difficult if not impossible to undo.</p>\n",

It\u2019s definitely really close in practice to what Rust is doing, just with a bunch of different trade-offs.</p>\n<p>Since GC was mentioned, I think it might be worth expanding on how GCed languages can be \u201cmemory safe\u201d but still lead to buggy code. The main issue I notice with GCs is that they <em>only</em> guarantee that all your pointers are (still) valid, <em>not that they point to what you actually want</em>. A classic issue I\u2019ve run into in GCed languages is that you can take a reference to an element of an array, then mutate the array, and you might wind up with a pointer to an orphan element, or not the element you logically intended to point to at that point in the code. Rust doesn\u2019t have a GC but you can emulate similar semantics with reference counts. If you do that though, exactly what is being cloned when becomes explicit in the code: you can write exactly the same logically incorrect code, but you have to be more explicit about it so it\u2019s less likely to happen by accident.</p>\n<p>Aside: You don\u2019t actually need the <code>Box::leak(Box::new(0))</code> in the article, you can just return a reference to a statically allocated 0. Just replacing that whole line with <code>&amp;0</code> will compile fine. That only works for read-only references though, if you need to return a mutable reference you need to go back to leaking memory or a Cow-like solution (e.g. <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/mucow\" rel=\"ugc\">https://crates.io/crates/mucow</a>, but at that point I\u2019d argue you\u2019re probably better off rethinking the API).</p>\n",

    "content": "Once upon a time (and that time was Winter CES 1983), Commodore announced what was to be their one and only handheld computer, the Commodore HHC-4. It was never released and never seen again, at least not in that form. But it turns out that not only did the HHC-4 actually exist, it also wasn't manufactured by Commodore \u2014 it was a Toshiba. Like Superman had Clark Kent, the Commodore HHC-4 had a secret identity too: the Toshiba Pasopia Mini IHC-8000, the very first portable computer Toshiba ever made. And like Clark Kent was Superman with glasses, compare the real device to the Commodore marketing photo and you can see that it's the very same machine modulo a plastic palette swap. Of course there's more to the story than that. Recall, as we've discussed in other articles, that 1980s handheld and pocket computers occupied something of a continuum and the terms were imprecise, though as a rule handheld computers tended to be larger and emphasize processing power over size and battery life, while pocket computers tended to be smaller and emphasize size and low power usage over capability. Thus you had computers that were \"definitely pocket computers,\" like the Casio PB-100/Tandy PC-4 and Sharp PC-1250/Tandy PC-3, and \"definitely handheld computers\" like the Kyotronic 85 series (TRS-80 Model 100, NEC PC-8201A, etc.), Convergent WorkSlate and Texas Instruments CC-40, but also handheld-class computers sold as pocket computers like the Sharp PC-1500/Tandy PC-2 and Casio PB-1000C, and even a few handheld-sized computers with capabilities more typical of pocket computers like the VTech Laser 50. Small systems like these were hot in their day, not least from novelty and size appeal, and nearly every computer company was dabbling in them. The vast majority originated in Japan, primarily from Casio and Sharp, but also from other lesser-known manufacturers like Canon. Because of their unique constraints on size and battery usage, some notable exceptions notwithstanding (at least one of which we'll have a look at), pocket computers in particular often used unusual architectures seen nowhere else. Toshiba is a contraction of T&omacr;ky&omacr; Shibaura Denki kabushiki-kaisha (Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd.), formed in 1939 as a merger between Shibaura Seisakusho (Shibaura Engineering Works) and T&omacr;ky&omacr; Denki (Tokyo Electric). Both were licensees of American conglomerate General Electric who owned substantial portions of each of them at the time. Although it carried the well-known nickname for years, the unified enterprise did not formally rename itself to Toshiba Corporation until 1979. As Tokyo Shibaura Electric, Toshiba produced its first computer in 1954, the TAC, an EDSAC clone with 7,000 vacuum tubes and 3,000 diodes delivered as a prototype to the University of Tokyo. It eventually produced minis like the TOSBAC-3400, based on Kyoto University's 1961 KT-Pilot, and produced its first microprocessor, the 12-bit TLCS-12 (\"Toshiba LSI Computer System\"), in 1973 for Ford automotive engine control units. The upgraded TLCS-12A became the basis of Toshiba's first microcomputer, a single-board evaluation system, and then reworked around the Intel 8080A (using the compatible Toshiba TMP9080AC at 2.048MHz) for the 1978 TLCS80A \u2022 EX-80, or EX-80 for short. At that time it was the cheapest system that could output to a TV using built-in hardware, displaying 10x26 text (not a typo) or 80x26 graphics from its standard 1K of RAM. In 1979 Toshiba developed the T-400 as a demonstration personal computer, using the upgraded EX-80BS (\"BASIC System\") and Toshiba's second-source version of the Intel 8085. It had a 32x24 text display, eight colours and up to 256x192 graphics, supporting up to 36K of RAM. Toshiba intended to offer it to overseas retailers as an OEM, but it got little import interest, and the company took it back to the shop to refine the design. Thus was the nucleus of the Toshiba Pasopia line, though it quickly became more of a generic brand than a distinct technical segment and many machines ultimately sold under the label weren't closely related. The original 1981 Pasopia, sold in the United States as the Toshiba T100, was a 4MHz Z80 system offering two flavours of BASIC, 64K of RAM, three-voice sound using the Texas Instruments SN76489 DCSG and up to 640x200 graphics. A notable later option, along with the more typical disk drives, RS-232 and parallel expansions, was an optional LCD mounted on its keyboard, but we'll come back to this at the end. On the other hand, the 1982 Pasopia 16 was a completely different PC-compatible system, running Intel's HMOS 8088-2 at 6MHz (as compared to the slower original NMOS 8088) and supporting up to 256K of RAM and MS-DOS 2.3 and CP/M-86. It had custom graphics hardware with up to 16 colours and 640x500 resolution. The P16 was also sold in the United States as the T300 and in Europe as the PAP. These two computers ended up forming two completely separate lineages that nevertheless were also badged as Pasopias. Due to poor sales outside their native country, their descendants were sold only in Japan. On the classic Pasopia side, Toshiba released the Pasopia 5 in 1983, a cost-reduced version of the O.G. Pasopia with the same features, along with the Pasopia 7 (and later the closely related Pasopia 700 in 1985), an upgraded and partially-compatible successor featuring a second TI SN76489 sound chip, three times the video RAM and more video modes. For its part, the Pasopia 16 separately evolved into the 1984 Pasopia 1600, with an 8MHz HMOS 8086-2 and up to 384K of video RAM, and the Pasopia 1600 TS100 and TS300, which had an 8MHz 80286 and up to 704K of RAM, with either dual 5.25\" floppies (TS100) or one floppy and a 20MB hard disk (TS300). To confuse things further, Toshiba also sold a line of MSX machines called the Pasopia IQ, releasing the HX-10, HX-20 and HX-30 series in 1983, 1984 and 1985 respectively. Some of these machines were sold in Europe, with only the Japanese versions having Pasopia IQ branding, and the last few models supported the MSX2 standard. Toshiba",

    "content": "Autumn trees on a dusty road in Magoebaskloof, South Africa. Photo by Garren Smith, iPhone 13 Pro. Tigris now supports object notifications! Object notifications are how you receive events every time something changes in a bucket. Think of it as your bucket's way of saying \"Hey, something happened! Come check it out!\", much like the inotify subsystem in Linux. These notifications can be helpful for keeping track of what's going on in your application. Use Case: Automatic Image Processing\u200b Imagine you're building a photo-sharing app. Every time a user uploads a new picture, you want to automatically generate a thumbnail and maybe even run it through an AI to detect any inappropriate content. With object notifications, this becomes a breeze! User uploads an image to your Tigris bucket. Tigris sends a notification to your webhook. Your server receives the notification and springs into action. It downloads the new image, creates a thumbnail, and runs it through an AI check. The processed image and its metadata are saved back to Tigris. All of this happens automatically, triggered by that initial upload. Behind the Scenes: Building Object Notifications\u200b Now, let's pull back the curtain and see how we built this feature and a few tricky situations we had to handle. Grab your hard hat, because we're going on a little tour of Tigris's inner workings! Tigris isn't just any object store \u2013 it's a global object store. This means that objects can be changed in multiple regions around the world. This makes them available in multiple regions, always ready when you need them. But means we need a way of keeping track of all the changes for the same object. This is where replication comes in. Replication: Keeping Everyone in the Loop\u200b To make sure everything stays in sync, we replicate changes to multiple regions. This ensures high availability and improved redundancy of our objects. The caveat to this is that replication is a background task, and the speed at which an object is replicated from one region to another can be affected by many external factors. To solve this, when a change is received at a region it looks at the Last Modified timestamp of the metadata to determine if the change is new and needs to be applied or if the region has already seen a newer change. It will discard the change if it is old. The Object Notification Hub\u200b When object notifications are enabled for a bucket, we assign one region to be the object notification hub for that bucket. This region gets the important job of keeping track of all the changes. We create a special index which is very similar to a secondary index in that region's FoundationDB. We order the changes by FoundationDB Versionstamp, when the change is added to the index, and Last Modified timestamp of object metadata. The Versionstamp helps the worker keep track of which events it has seen and processed. Why one region you may ask? If we didn't do this, we end up with multiple regions sending the same events to the webhook, hello friendly DDos attack, or having to build a complex system to try and co-ordinate the regions so they don't send duplicate events. The Background Task: Our Diligent Messenger\u200b In our object notification region, we have a background task running. Think of it as a tireless worker that's always on the lookout for changes. Every so often, it checks the special index we mentioned earlier, collects all the latest changes, and sends them off to the webhook. The worker will also keep track of the last processed change and will retry a few times if the request failed. Finally it will remove old changes from the index that have already been processed. Why We Can't Guarantee Ordered Events\u200b We talked about how object changes replicated from many regions can take different times. The problem arises when the worker is ready to send the latest events for an object. It has no way of knowing if all changes for an object have been replicated to its region. It could in theory contact every region and check, but this would be prohibitively expensive. And still not a complete guarantee. This forces us to make the trade off of sending events out of order. The worker will read the latest list of changes that have been replicated to the region and send them to the webhook. Wrapping Up\u200b That's how we built object notifications in Tigris. We took a global system, added some global replication, threw in a change index, topped it off with a hardworking background task. The result? A system that keeps you in the loop about what's happening in your buckets, no matter where in the world those changes occur. Whether you're building the next big photo-sharing app or just want to keep tabs on your storage, object notifications have got your back! We hope this peek behind the scenes was fun and informative. Happy coding!",

    "content": "Database Remote-Copy Tool For SQLite Table Of Contents 1. Overview The following command causes REPLICA to become a copy of ORIGIN: $ sqlite3_rsync ORIGIN REPLICA ?OPTIONS? Use the --help or -? flag to see the complete list of options. Option flags may appear before, after, or between the ORIGIN and REPLICA arguments. Add the -v option to see more output, in a format similar to \"rsync\". 2. Features One or the other of ORIGIN or REPLICA may be of the form \"USER@HOST:PATH\". The other is just a simple PATH. This utility causes REPLICA to be a copy of ORIGIN. If REPLICA does not already exist, it is created. ssh is used for communication, so \"USER@HOST\" may be an SSH alias. It is not required that one of ORIGIN or REPLICA be remote. The sqlite3_rsync utility works fine if both ORIGIN and REPLIA are local. Both databases may be \"live\" while this utility is running. Other programs can have active connections to the databases on either end while this utility is running. Other programs can write to ORIGIN and can read from REPLICA while this utility runs. REPLICA becomes a copy of a snapshot of ORIGIN as it existed when the sqlite3_rsync command started. If other processes change the content of ORIGIN while this command is running, those changes will be applied to ORIGIN, but they are not transferred to REPLICA Thus, REPLICA ends up as a fully-consistent snapshot of ORIGIN at an instant in time. The synchronization uses a bandwidth-efficient protocol, similar to rsync (from which its name is derived). 3. Limitations The database files must both be in WAL mode, and must have the same page-size. While sqlite3_rsync is running, REPLICA is read-only. Queries can be run against REPLICA while this utility is running, just not write transactions. Only a single database is synchronized for each invocation of this utility. It is not (yet) possible to synchronize many different databases using wildcards, as it is with standard \"rsync\". At least one of ORIGIN or REPLICA must be on the local machine. They cannot both be databases on other machines. On the remote system, this utility must be installed in one of the directories in the default $PATH for SSH. The /usr/local/bin directory is often a good choice. Alternately, the --exe NAME flag may be used to specify a remote location for the binary, e.g. --exe /opt/bin/sqlite3_rsync. The replica will be a very close copy of the origin, but not an exact copy. All of the table (and index) content will be byte-for-byte identical in the replica. However, there can be some minor changes in the database header. In particular, the replica will have the following differences from the origin: The change counter in bytes 24 through 27 of the database header might be incremented in the replica. The version-valid-for number in bytes in 96 through 99 of the database header will be the SQLite version number of the sqlite3_rsync program that made the copy, not the version number of the last writer to the origin database. On Windows, a single-letter HOST without a USER@ prefix will be interpreted as a Windows drive-letter, not as a hostname. 4. How To Install Install sqlite3_rsync simply by putting the executable somewhere on your $PATH. If you are synchronizing with a remote system, the sqlite3_rsync executable must be installed on both the local and the remote system. When installing the sqlite3_rsync executable on the remote system, ensure that it is found on the $PATH used by SSH. Putting the sqlite3_rsync executable in the /usr/local/bin directory is often a good choice. Unfortunately, on MacOS, the default PATH for ssh is \"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\" and MacOS does not allow you to add new programs to any of those directories. So if you are trying to sync with a remote Mac, you'll have to add the --exe command line argument to sqlite3_rsync to specify the location where you have installed sqlite3_rsync on the remote side. For example: sqlite3_rsync sample.db mac:sample.db --exe /Users/xyz/bin/sqlite3_rsync The writer of this document has never had any success in getting SSHD to run on Windows. Perhaps he will figure that out and be able to provide instructions for syncing a database to or from a remote Windows machine in a future release. 5. Network Bandwidth The protocol is for the replica to send a cryptographic hash of each of its pages over to the origin side, then the origin sends back the complete content of any page for which the hash does not match. Suppose the replica contains R pages. If the replica and the origin are already identical, then about R*20 bytes of hash are sent from the replica to the origin, and apart from some trivial overhead and housekeeping traffic, nothing else moves over the wire. So for databases with a 4096-byte page size, the minimum bandwidth required to run this utility is equivalent to about 0.5% of the database. The worst case synchronization occurs if the replica and origin are completely different and have no pages in common. In that case, about total network traffic is about 100.5% of the database size. The calculations in the previous paragraph do not consider the compression that SSH implements. Most SQLite databases are compressible and so the bandwidth cost of a complete synchronization is probably less than 100.5% of the database size. However, the cryptographic page hashes are not compressible, so the best case will never be better than about 0.5% of the database size, for a 4096-byte page size. Minimum bandwidth required goes down for larger page sizes. The best case is about 0.03% of the database size for databases with a 65,536-byte page size. 6. Why Can't I Just Use Ordinary rsync? Ordinary rsync does not understand SQLite transactions. Rsync will make a copy of ORIGIN into REPLICA, however the copy might not be consistent. Parts of the copy might be from one transaction, while other parts might from a different transaction. The database copy might be corrupt. If no other processes",

    "content": "I'm not terribly happy with how running unit tests inside my assembler work. I mean, it works, as in, it tests the code and show problems during the assembly phase, but I don't like how you write the tests in the first place. Here's one of the tests I added to my maze generation program (and the routine it tests): getpixel bsr point_addr ; get video address comb ; reverse mask (since we're reading stb ,-s ; the screen, not writing it) ldb ,x ; get video data andb ,s+ ; mask off the pixel tsta ; any shift? beq .done .rotate lsrb ; shift color bits deca bne .rotate .done rts ; return color in B .test .opt test pokew ECB.beggrp , $0E00 .opt test poke $0E00 , %11_11_11_11 lda #0 ldb #0 bsr getpixel .assert /d = 3 .assert /x = @@ECB.beggrp lda #1 ldb #0 bsr getpixel .assert /d = 3 .assert /x = @@ECB.beggrp lda #2 ldb #0 bsr getpixel .assert /d = 3 .assert /x = @@ECB.beggrp lda #3 ldb #0 bsr getpixel .assert /d = 3 .assert /x = @@ECB.beggrp rts .endtst The problem is the machine code for the test is included in the final binary output, which is bad because I can't just set an option to run the tests in addition to assembling the code into its final output, which I don't want (and that means when I use the test backend, I tend to generate the output to /dev/null). I've also found that I prefer table-style tests to writing code (for reasons way beyond the scope of this entry). For example, for a C function like this: int max_monthday(int year,int month) { static int const days[] = { 31,0,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31 } ; assert(year > 1969); assert(month > 0); assert(month < 13); if (month == 2) { /*---------------------------------------------------------------------- ; in case you didn't know, leap years are those years that are divisible ; by 4, except if it's divisible by 100, then it's not, unless it's ; divisible by 400, then it is. 1800 and 1900 were NOT leap years, but ; 2000 is. ;----------------------------------------------------------------------*/ if ((year % 400) == 0) return 29; if ((year % 100) == 0) return 28; if ((year % 4) == 0) return 29; return 28; } else return days[month - 1]; } I would prefer to write test code like: Test code for max_monthday() output year month 28 1900 2 29 2000 2 28 2100 2 29 1904 2 29 2104 2 28 2001 2 Just specify the inputs and outputs for some corner cases, and let the computer do what is necessary to call the function in question. But it's not so easy with assembly language, given the large number of ways to pass data into a function, and the number of output results one can have. How would I specify that the inputs come in registers A and B, and the outputs come in A, B and X? The above could be done in a table format, I guess. It might not be pretty, but it's doable. Then there's these subroutines and their associated tests: ;*********************************************************************** ; RND4 Generate a random number 0 .. 3 ;Entry: none ;Exit: B - random number ;*********************************************************************** rnd4 dec rnd4.cnt ; any more cached random #s? bpl .cached ; yes, get next cached number ldb #3 ; else reset count stb rnd4.cnt bsr random ; get random number stb rnd4.cache ; save in the cache bra .ret ; and return the first number .cached ldb rnd4.cache ; get cached value lsrb ; get next 2-bit random number lsrb stb rnd4.cache ; save ermaining bits .ret andb #3 ; mask off our result rts ;*********************************************************************** ; RANDOM Generate a random number ;Entry: none ;Exit: B - random number (1 - 255) ;*********************************************************************** random ldb lfsr andb #1 negb andb #$B4 stb ,-s ; lsb = -(lfsr & 1) & taps ldb lfsr lsrb ; lfsr >>= 1 eorb ,s+ ; lfsr ^= lsb stb lfsr rts .test ldx #.result_array clra clrb .setmem sta ,x+ decb bne .setmem ldx #.result_array + 128 lda #1 sta lfsr lda #255 .loop bsr random .assert /b <> 0 , \"degenerate LFSR\" .assert @/b,x = 0 , \"non-repeating LFSR\" inc b,x deca bne .loop clr ,x clr 1,x clr 2,x clr 3,x lda #255 .chk4 bsr rnd4 .assert /b >= 0 .assert /b <= 3 inc b,x deca bne .chk4 .tron ldb ,x ; to check the spread ldb 1,x ; of results, basically ldb 2,x ; these should be roughly ldb 3,x ; 1/4 of 256 .troff .assert @/,x + @/1,x + @/2,x + @/3,x = 255 rts .result_array rmb 256 .endtst .test \"whole program\" .opt test pokew $A000 , KEYIN .opt test pokew $FFFE , END .opt test prot r,$A000,$A001 lbsr start KEYIN lda #'Q' END rts .endtst And \u2026 just uhg. I mean, this checks that the 8-bit LFSR I'm using to generate random numbers actually doesn't repeat within it's 255-period cycle, and that the number of 2-bit random numbers I generate from RND4 is more or less evenly spread, and for both of those, I use an array to store the intermediate results. I leary about including an interpreter just for the tests, because I don't think it would be any better. At least the test code is largely written in the target language of 6809 assembly. Then again, I could embed Lua, and write the tests like: .test local array = {} for i = 0 , 255 do array[i] = 0 end mem['lfsr'] = 1 for i = 0 , 255 do call 'random' assert(cpu.B ~= 0) assert(array[cpu.B] == 0) array[cpu.B] = 1 end array[0] = 0 array[1] = 0 array[2] = 0 array[3] = 0 for i = 0 , 255 do call 'rnd4' assert(cpu.B >= 0) assert(cpu.B <= 3) array[cpu.B] = array[cpu.B] + 1 end assert(array[0] + array[1] + array[2] + array[3] == 255) .endtst I suppose? I would still need to somehow code the fake",

Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or MathML the way Wikipedia does. Update: I implemented the ideas in this blog post (and more) in a program/library, MOAC Toggle table of contents Table of Contents Intro\u00adduction Asking the right question Quantifying password strength. The Problem Caveats and estimates Compu\u00adtation Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe Calculating the critical density of the observable universe Solving for E Final Solution Sample unbreakable passwords Conclusion, TLDR Further reading: alternative approaches Approaches that account for computation speed Ac\u00adknowledge\u00adments Intro\u00adduction I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the future. How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever? This question might not be especially practical, but it\u2019s fun to analyze and offers interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength. Asking the right question Let\u2019s limit the scope of this article to passwords used in encryption/decryption. An attacker is trying to guess a password to decrypt something. Instead of predicting what tomorrow\u2019s computers may be able to do, let\u2019s examine the biggest possible brute-force attack that the laws of physics can allow. A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn\u2019t the bottleneck, energy usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy. In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of the entire observable universe? Let\u2019s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute, and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with amazing framerates. How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the MOAC? Quantifying password strength. A previous version of this section wasn\u2019t clear and accurate. I\u2019ve since removed the offending bits and added a clarification about salting/hashing to the Caveats and estimates section. A good measure of password strength is entropy bits. The entropy bits in a password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force it.note 1 A brute-force attack that executes 2n guesses is certain to crack a password with n entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password with n+1 entropy bits. For scale, AES-256 encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption, and uses key lengths of 256-bits. An exhaustive key search over a 256-bit key space would be up against its 2256 possible permutations. When using AES-256 encryption with a key derived from a password with more than 256 entropy bits, the entropy of the AES key is the bottleneck; an attacker would fare better by doing an exhaustive key search for the AES key than a brute-force attack for the password. To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as zxcvbn or KeePassXC. The Problem Define a function P. P determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess a password with n bits of entropy after using e energy: P(n, e) If P(n, e) \u2265 1, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of energy. The lower P(n, e) is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your password. Caveats and estimates I don\u2019t have a strong physics background. A brute-force attack will just guess a single password until the right one is found. Brute-force attacks won\u2019t \u201cdecrypt\u201d stored passwords, because they\u2019re not supposed to be stored encrypted; they\u2019re typically salted and hashed. When estimating, we\u2019ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an upper limit on password strength. We\u2019ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment. Quantum computers can use Grover\u2019s algorithm for an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover\u2019s algorithm, calculate P(n/2, e) instead. Others are better equipped to explain encryption/hashing/key-derivation algorithms, so I won\u2019t; this is just a pure and simple brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy, assuming that the cryptography is bulletproof. Obviously, I\u2019m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime real. Finally, there\u2019s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a password with a given entropy. Literal \u201cimmunity\u201d is impossible. Lowering this probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to brute-force attacks. Compu\u00adtation How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on kT. k represents the Boltzmann Constant (about 1.381\u00d710-23 J/K) and T represents the temperature of the system. Their product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a system\u2019s entropy. A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the Plank-Einstein relation. It\u2019s also probably a better idea to",

My team at Klara spent many months in 2023 and 2024 working on it, and we reckon its pretty good, a huge step up from the old dedup as well as being a solid base for further improvements. I\u2019ve been watching various forums and mailing lists since it was announced, and the thing I kept seeing was people saying something like \u201cit has the same problems as the old dedup; needs too much memory, nukes your performance\u201d. While that was true (ish), and is now significantly less true, the real problem is that this just repeating the same old non-information that they probably heard from someone else repeating it. I don\u2019t blame anyone really; it is true that dedup has been extremely challenging to get the best out of, it\u2019s very difficult to find good information about using it well, and \u201cdon\u2019t use it\u201d was and remains almost certainly the right answer. But, with this being the first time in almost two decades that dedup has been worth even considering, I want to get some fresh information out there about the what dedup is, how it worked traditionally and why it was usually bad, what we changed with fast dedup, and why it\u2019s still probably not the thing you want. Table of contents What even is dedup? \ud83d\udd17 Dedup can be easily described in a sentence. When OpenZFS prepares to write some data to disk, if that data is already on disk, don\u2019t do the write but instead, add a reference to the existing copy. The challenge is all in how you determine whether or not the data is already on disk, and knowing where on disk it is. The reason it\u2019s challenging is that that information has to be stored and retrieved, which is additional IO that we didn\u2019t have to do before, and that IO can add surprising amounts of overhead! This stored information is the \u201cdedup table\u201d. Conceptually, it\u2019s hashtable, with the data checksum as the \u201ckey\u201d and the on-disk location and refcount as the \u201cvalue\u201d. It\u2019s stored in the pool as part of the pool metadata, that is, it\u2019s considered \u201cstructural\u201d pool data, not user data. How does dedup work? \ud83d\udd17 When dedup is enabled, the \u201cwrite\u201d IO path is modified. As normal, a data block is prepared by the DMU and handed to the SPA to be written to disk. Encryption and compression are performed as normal and then the checksum is calculated. Without dedup, the metaslab allocator is called to request space on the pool to store the block, and the locations (DVAs) are returned and copied into the block pointer. When dedup is enabled, OpenZFS instead looks up the checksum in the dedup table. If it doesn\u2019t find it, it calls out to the metaslab allocator as normal, gets fresh DVAs, fills the block and lets the IO through to be written to disks as normal, and then creates a new dedup table entry with the checksum, DVAs and the refcount set to 1. On the other hand, if it does find it, it copies the DVAs from the the value into the block pointer and returns the writing IO as \u201ccompleted\u201d and then increments the refcount. Blocks allocated with dedup enabled have a special D flag set on the block pointer. This is to assist when it comes time to free the block. The \u201cfree\u201d IO path is similarly modified to check for the D flag. If it exists, the same dedup table lookup happens, and the refcount is decremented. If the refcount is non-zero, the IO is returned as \u201ccompleted\u201d, but if it reaches zero, then the last \u201ccopy\u201d of the block is being freed, so the dedup table entry is deleted and the metaslab allocator is called to deallocate the space. So all this is working, in that OpenZFS is avoiding writing multiple copies of the same data. The downside is that every single write and free operation requires a lookup and a then a write to the dedup table, regardless of whether or not the write or free proper was actually done by the pool. It should be clear then that any dedup system worth using needs to save more in \u201ctrue\u201d space and IO than it spends on the overhead of managing the table. And this is the fundamental issue with traditional dedup: these overheads are so outrageous that you are unlikely to ever get them back except on rare and specific workloads. Why is traditional dedup so bad? \ud83d\udd17 All of the detail of dedup is in how the table is stored, and how it interacts with the IO pipeline. There\u2019s three main categories of problem with the traditional setup: the construction and storage of the dedup table itself the overheads required to accumulate and stage changes to the dedup table the problem of \u201cunique\u201d entries in the table The dedup table \ud83d\udd17 Traditional dedup implemented the dedup table in probably the simplest way that might work: it just hooked up the standard OpenZFS on-disk hashtable object and called it a day. This object type is a \u201cZAP\u201d, and it\u2019s used throughout OpenZFS for file directories, property lists and internal housekeeping. It\u2019s an entirely reasonable choice. It\u2019s also really not well suited to an application like dedup. A ZAP is a fairly complicated structure, and I\u2019m not going to get into it here. For our purposes, it\u2019s enough to know that each data block in a ZAP object is an array of fixed-size \u201cchunks\u201d, with a single key/value consuming as many chunks as are needed to hold the key, the data, and and a header describing how the chunks are being used. A dedup entry has a 40-byte key. The value part can be up to 256 bytes, however this is compressed before storing it, so lets assume",

ARPANET has not yet happened (that would become a thing in the 60s), and every operating system was typically tied to the hardware that was meant to run on. Most communication actually happened over telephone, and no company was more present in that space than the Bell System. Unfortunately, the way they were so present was through exclusive supply contracts (with its subsidiary Western Electric) and a vast array of patents that it would refuse to license to competitors. So they got an antitrust suit aimed at them, which after seven years of litigation culminated in the 1956 consent decree. The Bell System was broken up, obliged to license all of its patents royalty-free, and barred from entering any industry other than telecommunications. So they made Unix. Unix was unique, because the focus was on the software (since Bell couldn\u2019t compete in this space anyway, as per the above). An evolution of Multics, it was developed on a PDP-7 (by cross-compiling). They then ported a compiler-compiler to it, leading to the development of B. Once their internal needs outgrew the PDP-7, it got ported to the PDP-11, and gained full typesetting capabilities. Gaining some traction internally, when Bell acquired other PDP-11s, instead of running DEC\u2019s own OS for the machine, they simply ran Unix on it. This has led to the rewrite of the OS in C, a higher level (comparatively, of course) language, which enabled the porting of it to other machines (like the Interdata 7/32 and 8/32). Interest grew, and Bell (not being allowed to turn Unix into a product) simply shipped it at manufacturing cost for the media. Notably, ARPANET used it (see: RFC 681). In the early 1980s, Unix had become a univeral operating system, used on virtually every serious machine. Then, AT&T got hit by an antitrust suit again. The exact details matter less, but freed it from the old restriction. System V immediately turned into a product, almost killing it. That very year, the GNU project was created, and the BSD project was started in Berkeley. Having grown accustomed to interoperability (since up until that point, there was only really one serious Unix), several standardization attempts were created. The System V Interface Definition was the AT&T one, Europe created the X/Open consortium of Single UNIX Specification fame, and the IEEE put out POSIX. These latter two would eventually merge and become equivalent, developed by the Austin Group, defining the only interface said to be universally interoperable on the OS level that we have to this day. As of the previous release of POSIX, the Austin Group gained more control over the specification, having it be more working group oriented, and they got to work making the POSIX specification more modern. POSIX 2024 is the first release that bears the fruits of this labor, and as such, the changes made to it are particularly interesting, as they will define the direction of the specification going forwards. This is what this article is about! Well, mostly. POSIX is composed of a couple of sections. Notably XBD (Base Definitions, which talk about things like what a file is, how regular expressions work, etc), XSH (System Interfaces, the C API that defines POSIX\u2019s internals), and XCU (which defines the shell command language, and the standard utilities available for the system). There\u2019s also XRAT, which explains the rationale of the authors, but it\u2019s less relevant for our purposes today. XBD and XRAT are both interesting as context for XSH and XCU, but those are the real meat of the specification. This article will focus on the XCU section, in particular the utilities part of that section. If you\u2019re more interested in the XSH section, there\u2019s an excellent summary page by sortix\u2019s Jonas Termansen that you can read here. Highlights # Handling of Filenames in Shell # One of the most common errors in shell scripts when working with files tends to be the presumption that the newline character (\\n) will not be present in the filename. Consider, for example, wanting to do some processing of files in a directory, processing the most recently modified ones first, with some custom break condition. The most common (naive) way of implementing this looks like this: 1ls -t | while read -r f; do 2 # if my condition; then break; fi 3 # do something with $f 4done After all, read(1p) reads logical lines from stdin into a variable, and ls(1p) outputs one entry per line. The problem is that pathnames (as per section 3.254 of POSIX 2024) are just strings (meaning they can contain any bytes except the NUL character), meaning it\u2019s incorrect to even treat it as a character string, let alone something you can put in a newline-separated form. As such, the correct solution, historically, has been to loop over the files in some other way (such as wildcards, which aren\u2019t subject to expansion, or using find(1p)), then sort them, then run on the sorted datatype. This question is probably one of the most talked about in shell. POSIX 2024 addresses this issue in two ways. The Null Option # find(1p) now supports the -print0 primary, which makes find use the NUL character as a separator. To go along with it, xargs(1p) now supports the -0 argument, which reads arguments expecting them to be separated with NUL characters. Finally, for (most) other usecases, read(1p) now supports the -d (delimiter) argument, where -d '' means the NUL character is the delimiter. This is a non-ideal resolution though. Previous POSIX releases have considered -print0 before, but never ended up adopting it because using a null terminator meant that any utility that would need to process that output would need to have a new option to parse that type of output. More precisely, this approach does not resolve our original problem. xargs(1p) can\u2019t sort, and therefore we still have to handle that logic separately, unless sort(1p) also grows this support, even",

    "content": "The web is losing. Badly. But a comeback is possible. October 27, 2024 This post is an edited and expanded version of a now-mangled Mastodon thread. Some in the JavaScript community imagine that I harbour an irrational dislike of their tools when, in fact, I want nothing more than to stop thinking about them. Live-and-let-live is excellent guidance, and if it weren't for React et. al.'s predictably ruinous outcomes, the public side of my work wouldn't involve educating about the problems JS-first development has caused. But that's not what strategy demands, and strategy is my job. I've been holding my fire (and the confidences of consulting counterparties) for most of the last decade. Until this year, I only occasionally posted traces documenting the worsening rot. I fear this has only served to make things look better than they are. Over the past decade, my work helping teams deliver competitive PWAs gave me a front-row seat to a disturbing trend. The rate of failure to deliver minimally usable experiences on phones seemed to be increasing over time, despite the accelerating costs associated with the client-side JS-based stacks that teams were reaching for. Worse and costlier is a bad combo, and the opposite of what competing ecosystems did. Native developers reset hard when moving from desktop to mobile, getting deeply in touch with the new constraints. Sure, developing a codebase multiple times is more expensive than the web's write-once-test-everywhere approach, but at least you got speed for the extra cost. But that's not what happened on the web. Contemporary frontend practice pretended that legacy-oriented, desktop-focused tools would perform fine in this new context, without ever checking if they did. When that didn't work, the toxic-positivity crowd blamed the messanger. Frontend's tragically timed turn towards JavaScript means the damage isn't limited to the public sector or \"bad\" developers. Some of the strongest engineers I know find themselves mired in the same quicksand. Today's popular JS-based approaches are simply unsafe at any speed. The rot is now ecosystem-wide, and JS-first culture owns a share of the responsibility. But why do I care? Platforms Are Competitions # My primary motivation is that I want the web to win. What does that mean? Concretely, folks should be able to accomplish most of their daily tasks on the web. But capability isn't sufficient; for the web to win in practice, users need to turn to the browser for those tasks because it's easier, faster, and more secure. A reasonable diagnostic metric of success is time spent as a percentage of time on device. The fraction of \"Jobs To Be Done\" happening on the web would be the natural leading metric, but it's hard to track. This phrasing \u2014 fraction of time spent, rather than absolute time \u2014 has the benefit of not being thirsty. It's also tracked by various parties. OK, but why should anyone prefer one platform over another? As I see it, the web is the only generational software platform that has a reasonable shot at delivering a potent set of benefits to users: Fresh Frictionless Safe by default Portable and interoperable Gatekeeper-free (no prior restraint on publication) Standards-based, and therefore... User-mediated (extensions, browser settings, etc.) Open Source compatible No other successful platform provides all of these today and others that could are too small to matter. Platforms like Android and Flutter deliver subsets of these properties but capitulate to capture by the host OS agenda, allowing their developers to be taxed through app stores and proprietary API lock-in. Most treat user mediation like a bug to be fixed. The web's inherent properties have created an ecosystem that is unique in the history of software, both in scope and resilience. ...and We're Losing # So why does this result in intermittent antagonism towards today's JS community? Because the web is losing, and instead of recognising that we're all in it together, then pitching in to right the ship, the Lemon Vendors have decided that predatory delay and \"I've got mine, Jack\"-ism is the best response. What do I mean by \"losing\"? Going back to the time spent metric, the web is cleaning up on the desktop. The web's JTBD percentage and fraction of time spent both continue to rise as we add new capabilities to the platform, displacing other ways of writing and delivering software, one fraction of a percent every year. But make no mistake; the web is the indispensable ecosystem for desktop users. Who, a decade ago, thought the web would be such a threat to Adobe's native app business that it would need to respond with a $20BN acquisition attempt and a full-fledged version of Photoshop (real Photoshop) on the web? Model advantages grind slowly but finely. They create space for new competitors to introduce the intrinsic advantages of their platform in previously stable categories. But only when specific criteria are met. Win Condition # First and foremost, challengers need a cost-competitive channel. That is, users have to be able to acquire software that runs on this new platform without a lot of extra work. The web drops channel costs to nearly zero, assuming... 80/20 capability. Essential use-cases in the domain have to be (reliably) possible for the vast majority (90+%) of the TAM. Some nice-to-haves might not be there, but the model advantage makes up for it. Lastly... It has to feel good. Performance can't suck for core tasks. It's fine for UI consistency with native apps to wander a bit. It's even fine for there to be a large peak performance delta. But the gap can't be such a gulf that it generally changes the interaction class of common tasks. So if the web is meeting all these requirements on desktop \u2013 even running away with the lead \u2013 why am I saying \"the web is losing\"? Because more than 75% of new devices that can run full browsers are phones. And the web is getting destroyed on mobile. Utterly routed. It's not going well This is what I started",

    "content": "Python f-strings are easy to use and very popular. Over time, however, developers have encountered limitations that make them unsuitable for certain use cases. In particular, f-strings provide no way to intercept and transform interpolated values before they are combined into a final string. As a result, incautious use of f-strings can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, a user executing a SQL query with sqlite3 may be tempted to use an f-string to embed values into their SQL expression, which could lead to a SQL injection attack. Or, a developer building HTML may include unescaped user input in the string, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. More broadly, the inability to transform interpolated values before they are combined into a final string limits the utility of f-strings in more complex string processing tasks. Template strings address these problems by providing developers with access to the string and its interpolated values. For example, imagine we want to generate some HTML. Using template strings, we can define an html() function that allows us to automatically sanitize content: evil = \"<script>alert('evil')</script>\" template = t\"<p>{evil}</p>\" assert html(template) == \"<p>&lt;script&gt;alert('evil')&lt;/script&gt;</p>\" Likewise, our hypothetical html() function can make it easy for developers to add attributes to HTML elements using a dictionary: attributes = {\"src\": \"shrubbery.jpg\", \"alt\": \"looks nice\"} template = t\"<img {attributes} />\" assert html(template) == '<img src=\"shrubbery.jpg\" alt=\"looks nice\" />' Neither of these examples is possible with f-strings. By providing a mechanism to intercept and transform interpolated values, template strings enable a wide range of string processing use cases. This PEP introduces a new string prefix, t, to define template string literals. These literals resolve to a new type, Template, found in a new top-level standard library module, templatelib. The following code creates a Template instance: from templatelib import Template template = t\"This is a template string.\" assert isinstance(template, Template) Template string literals support the full syntax of PEP 701. This includes the ability to nest template strings within interpolations, as well as the ability to use all valid quote marks (', \", ''', and \"\"\"). Like other string prefixes, the t prefix must immediately precede the quote. Like f-strings, both lowercase t and uppercase T prefixes are supported. Like f-strings, t-strings may not be combined with the b or u prefixes. Additionally, f-strings and t-strings cannot be combined, so the ft prefix is invalid as well. t-strings may be combined with the r prefix; see the Raw Template Strings section below for more information. Template strings evaluate to an instance of a new type, templatelib.Template: class Template: args: Sequence[str | Interpolation] def __init__(self, *args: str | Interpolation): ... The args attribute provides access to the string parts and any interpolations in the literal: name = \"World\" template = t\"Hello {name}\" assert isinstance(template.args[0], str) assert isinstance(template.args[1], Interpolation) assert template.args[0] == \"Hello \" assert template.args[1].value == \"World\" See Interleaving of Template.args below for more information on how the args attribute is structured. The Template type is immutable. Template.args cannot be reassigned or mutated. The Interpolation type represents an expression inside a template string. Like Template, it is a new concrete type found in the templatelib module: class Interpolation: value: object expr: str conv: Literal[\"a\", \"r\", \"s\"] | None format_spec: str __match_args__ = (\"value\", \"expr\", \"conv\", \"format_spec\") def __init__( self, value: object, expr: str, conv: Literal[\"a\", \"r\", \"s\"] | None = None, format_spec: str = \"\", ): ... Like Template, Interpolation is shallow immutable. Its attributes cannot be reassigned. The value attribute is the evaluated result of the interpolation: name = \"World\" template = t\"Hello {name}\" assert template.args[1].value == \"World\" The expr attribute is the original text of the interpolation: name = \"World\" template = t\"Hello {name}\" assert template.args[1].expr == \"name\" We expect that the expr attribute will not be used in most template processing code. It is provided for completeness and for use in debugging and introspection. See both the Common Patterns Seen in Processing Templates section and the Examples section for more information on how to process template strings. The conv attribute is the optional conversion to be used, one of r, s, and a, corresponding to repr(), str(), and ascii() conversions. As with f-strings, no other conversions are supported: name = \"World\" template = t\"Hello {name!r}\" assert template.args[1].conv == \"r\" If no conversion is provided, conv is None. The format_spec attribute is the format specification. As with f-strings, this is an arbitrary string that defines how to present the value: value = 42 template = t\"Value: {value:.2f}\" assert template.args[1].format_spec == \".2f\" Format specifications in f-strings can themselves contain interpolations. This is permitted in template strings as well; format_spec is set to the eagerly evaluated result: value = 42 precision = 2 template = t\"Value: {value:.{precision}f}\" assert template.args[1].format_spec == \".2f\" If no format specification is provided, format_spec defaults to an empty string (\"\"). This matches the format_spec parameter of Python\u2019s format() built-in. Unlike f-strings, it is up to code that processes the template to determine how to interpret the conv and format_spec attributes. Such code is not required to use these attributes, but when present they should be respected, and to the extent possible match the behavior of f-strings. It would be surprising if, for example, a template string that uses {value:.2f} did not round the value to two decimal places when processed. Developers can write arbitrary code to process template strings. For example, the following function renders static parts of the template in lowercase and interpolations in uppercase: from templatelib import Template, Interpolation def lower_upper(template: Template) -> str: \"\"\"Render static parts lowercased and interpolations uppercased.\"\"\" parts: list[str] = [] for arg in template.args: if isinstance(arg, Interpolation): parts.append(str(arg.value).upper()) else: parts.append(arg.lower()) return \"\".join(parts) name = \"world\" assert lower_upper(t\"HELLO {name}\") == \"hello WORLD\" There is no requirement that template strings are processed in any particular way. Code that processes templates has no obligation to return a string. Template strings are a flexible, general-purpose feature. See the Common Patterns Seen in Processing Templates section for more information on how to process template strings. See the Examples",

The application was previously deployed on Fly.io and relies on the Erlang VM's clustering capabilities, so I had to get this working on the Hetzner deployment I'd spun up using Kamal.It took me a bit of effort to get the clustering setup working, so here are my notes on what I did to get it working. It's also not a perfect setup at the moment, so if you have any suggestions do let me know!Initial setup(without clustering)Because mix already has a task to generate a Dockerfile, and that's all you really need for Kamal, this step was fairly easy.I created a setup with two roles:servers: web: hosts: - WEB_IP pipeline: hosts: - PIPELINE_IP I also created a private network in Hetzner:We'll use this private network later for our clustering setup.At this point, I was able to deploy to my servers and see my Phoenix app running but they weren't in a cluster.libcluster_hcloudI set up the Hetzner Cloud clustering strategy for libcluster using libcluster_hcloud. This uses the Hetzner API to find VMs to cluster with, filtered using label selectors so make sure you have the label you set in the config also set up on your VMs.config :libcluster, topologies: [ labels_example: [ strategy: Elixir.ClusterHcloud.Strategy.Labels, config: [ hcloud_api_access_token: \"xxx\", label_selector: \"cluster\", app_prefix: \"my_app\", show_debug: false, private_network_name: \"private-network\", polling_interval: 10_000]]],At this point, if you redeploy the app you should see in the logs that libcluster finds the VMs but isn't able to connect to them.2024-10-28T08:29:58.801497484Z 08:29:58.800 [warning] [libcluster:labels_example] unable to connect to :\"my_app@10.0.1.1\"Setting up distributionThe problem is that libcluster tries to find :\"my_app@10.0.1.1\" but we haven't named our node as such. So let's do that. In rel/env.sh.eex I added:#!/bin/sh export RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=\"name\" export RELEASE_NODE=\"my_app@${HOST_PRIVATE_IP}\"Setting RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=\"name\" ensures that we use fully qualified names that can talk to BEAMs in other VMs.Passing private IP address to containerWe want to use the private IP address as the hostname in the RELEASE_NODE as that's what libcluster is using. The complication here is that env.sh.eex gets rendered in a Docker container which isn't aware of the private network set up in the host VM.So we need to pass HOST_PRIVATE_IP to the container. Ideally, we would specify a command(ip addr ...) that retrieves the private IP address on the host before starting the container. But, unfortunately, looks like Kamal doesn't allow this. So, my hacky solution was to just hard-code the private IPs in my deploy.yml:servers: web: hosts: - WEB_IP env: clear: HOST_PRIVATE_IP: 10.0.2.1 pipeline: hosts: - PIPELINE_IP env: clear: HOST_PRIVATE_IP: 10.0.1.1If you have any suggestions on improving this, I'd love to hear it.Disabling EPMD and publishing distribution portBy default, enabling distribution means that there are two ports at play\u2013 the EPMD port(4369) and a randomly assigned port for each node in the cluster. Initially I tried constraining the range from which the port is randomly assigned using the flags described here but ran into issues connecting iex remotely.Instead, it is possible to use an EPMD-less approach(see here and here)# In vm.args.eex -start_epmd false -erl_epmd_port 6789 # In remote.vm.args.eex -start_epmd false -erl_epmd_port 6789 -dist_listen falseThis way we only have to expose port 6789 from our container.This is the config I had to add to my deploy.yml to publish the port:accessories: traefik: service: traefik image: traefik:v3.1 roles: - web - pipeline options: publish: - 6789:6789 cmd: \"--providers.docker --providers.docker.exposedByDefault=false --entryPoints.epmd.address=:6789 --log.level=INFO\" volumes: - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" labels: traefik.enable: true traefik.tcp.routers.epmd.rule: \"ClientIP(`0.0.0.0/0`)\" traefik.tcp.routers.epmd.priority: 5 traefik.tcp.routers.epmd.entryPoints: epmd traefik.tcp.routers.epmd.service: epmd traefik.tcp.services.epmd.loadBalancer.server.port: 6789This seems like another of Kamal's limitations\u2013 if you were directly invoking Docker, it's possible to just publish the port. But instead you have to set up Traefik to expose \"extra\" ports from your services.And with that, once you re-deploy, libcluster should now be able to connect with the nodes it finds.iex(pod_clipper@10.0.2.1)1> Node.list() [:\"pod_clipper@10.0.1.1\"] iex(pod_clipper@10.0.2.1)2>\ud83d\udc4b Thanks for reading!

    "content": "The Open Source Initiative (OSI) released the RC1 (\u201cRelease Candidate 1\u201d meaning: This thing is basically done and will be released as such unless something catastrophic happens) of the \u201cOpen Source AI Definition\u201c. Some people might wonder why that matters. Some people come up with a bit of writing on AI, what else is new? That\u2019s basically LinkedIn\u2019s whole existence currently. But the OSI has a very special role in the Open Source software ecosystem. Because Open Source isn\u2019t just based on the fact whether you can see code but also about the License that code is covered under: You might get code that you can see but that you are not allowed to touch (think of the recent WinAmp release debate). The OSI basically took on the role of defining which of the different licenses that were being used all over the place actually are \u201cOpen Source\u201d and which come with restrictions that undermine the idea. This is very important: Picking a license is a political act with strong consequences. It can allow or forbid different modes of interaction with an object or might put certain requirements to the use. The famous GPL for example allows you to take the code but forces you to also open your own changes to it. Other licenses do not enforce this demand. Choosing a license has tangible effects. Quick sidebar: \u201cOpen Source\u201d already is a bit of a problematic term, it\u2019s (my opinion) a way to depoliticise the idea of \u201cFree Software\u201c. Both do share certain ideas but where \u201cOpen Source\u201d frames things more in a pragmatic \u201ccorporations want to know which code they can use\u201d kind of way Free Software was always more of a political movement arguing more from a standpoint of user rights and liberation. An idea that was probably damaged the most by the most visible figures in that space that probably should just walk into the sea. So what makes a thing \u201cOpen Source\u201d? Well the OSI has a brief list. You can read it quickly but let\u2019s focus on Point 2: Source Code: The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed. To be Open Source a piece of software needs to come with the sources. Okay, that\u2019s not surprising. But the writers have seen some shit so they added that obfuscated code (meaning code that has been mangled to be unreadable) or intermediate forms (meaning you don\u2019t get the actual sources but something that has already been processed) are not allowed. Cool. Makes sense. But why do people care about sources? Sources of Truth Open Source is a relatively new mass phenomenon. We had software before, even some we didn\u2019t have to pay for. We called it \u201cFreeware\u201d back then. Freeware is software you can use without cost but that you don\u2019t get any source code to. You cannot change the program (legally), you cannot audit it, cannot add to it. But it\u2019s free of charge. And there was a lot of that back in my younger days. WinAMP, the audio player I talked about above used to be Freeware and basically everyone used it. So why even care about sources? For some it was about being able to modify the tools easier, especially if the maintainer of the software didn\u2019t really work on it any more or started adding all kinds of stuff you didn\u2019t agree with (think of all those proprietary software packages today you have to use for work that get AI stuffed in there behind every other button). But there is more to it than just feature requests. There\u2019s trust. When I run software, I need to trust the people who wrote it. Trust them to do a good job, to build reliable and robust software. To add only the features in the documentation and nothing hidden, potentially harmful. Especially with so large parts of our real lives running on digital infrastructures questions of trust get more and more important. We all know that we want fully open sourced, peer-reviewed and battle-tested encryption algorithms in our infrastructures to our communication is safe from harm. Open Source is \u2013 especially for critical systems and infrastructures \u2013 a key part of establishing that trust: Because you want (someone) to be able to verify what\u2019s up. There has been a long push for more reproducible builds. Those build processes basically guarantee that given the same code input you get the same compiled result. Which means that if you want to know if someone really delivered you exactly what they said they would you can check. Because your build process would create an identical artifact. Not everyone does this level of analysis of course. And even fewer people only use software from reproducible build processes \u2013 especially with a lot of software not being compiled today. But relationships are more nuanced than code and trust is a relationship: You being fully open book about your code and how exactly the binary version was built makes it a lot easier for me to trust you. To know what is in the software I am running on the machine that also has my bank statements or encryption keys on it. What does this have to do with AI? AI systems and 4 Freedoms AI systems are a bit special. Because \u2013 especially the big ones everyone is so fascinated by \u2013 don\u2019t really consist of a lot of code in comparison to their size. A neural network implementation is a few hundred lines",

    "content": "One protocol to rule them all: refining the ideas behind HTTP, BitTorrent, Gemini, and 9p. Goals as simple as possible without sacrificing our other goals (less complex than http) performs well under poor network conditions, even when payloads are large (unlike gemini) performs well under high latency (unlike 9p) good single-source performance (unlike BitTorrent) Non-Goals content negotiation (http Accept headers) mutable identifiers version negotiation all of these can be trivially handled via an outer protocol (eg. mutable identifiers can be handled with gemini cross-protocol redirects) Strategies a stateful request/response protocol similar to 9p, but with hash-identified urls similar to magnet links (these encode length and content hash) streams are encoded over tcp, tcp/tls, or quic to ensure reliable delivery. Notation each request has a number of fields. each field is marked either as a fixed number of bits, or as a \u201cstring\u201d field. \u201cstring\u201d fields consist of a 64 bit length value, followed by that many bytes. \u201cstring\u201d fields do not have to be valid utf-8 unless specified. all integers are little-endian. note that tokens are not integers, they are opaque client chosen identifiers with a length of 63 bits (followed by a 1 bit flag, which takes the place of the LSB of the final bytes). servers must take to mask the correct bit. Requests and Responses there are 2 request types: * OPEN * READ there are 2 response types: * OK * ERROR each request has the following structure: * (63 bits) new_token: a token identifying the results of the request * (1 bit) request_type: integer representing type of request * (n bits) type-dependent fields each response has the following structure: * (63 bits) request_token: the client-chosen token found in the request that generated this responce * (1 bit) is_error: set if the corresponding request generated an error (such as the server being unable to find the requested resource) * (string) payload: if is_error is set, then a human and machine readable UTF-8 string representing an error. otherwise, its interpretation depends on the type of the request. OPEN request open requests one extra \u201cstring\u201d field: * (string) uri: this field represents the uri of the resource to be downloaded. what schemes are supported depends on the server, but it is recommended to support at least urn:sha256:* uris. the payload of non-error responses to OPEN requests is ignored, and SHOULD be empty. READ request read requests have two extra fields: * (64 bits) offset: at what point to begin reading * (64 bits) length: the maximum number of payload bytes the server is allowed respond with. the payload of non-error responses to READ requests MUST be the empty string if and only if offset is greater than or equal to the total number of bytes in the resource, or if length is 0. if neither of these conditions are met, the payload MUST NOT be the empty string. when the server generates an error in response to a token, all further READ requests targeted at that token are canceled. this allows a client to begin sending READ requests before it has received a response to the OPEN request. URL schemes rtp much like the magnet url scheme, the rtp scheme consists entirly of predefined query parameters: (one or more) u: the uri/urn of the underlying resource. can be specified multiple times to specify multiple hashes for the resource (the client is expected to verify the hash, so specifying multiple u allows slowly migrating to a new hash algo). if multiple values are specified, they must correspond to the same resource. (up to one) l: the length of the resource (one or more) s: the server(s) that the resource can be retrieved from. if specified multiple times, the client may choose one, or perform a swarm download from several at once. these servers take the form of proto!addr!port, for example, tcp!example.com!7777. (this is based off of plan9 dial strings, since it seems to be the only well-specified way of specifying a method of transport) (zero or more) t: list of mime types that the resource may be interpreted as. clients MAY ignore values other than the first. (up to one) v: protocol version. if not specified, it defaults to version 1, which is the version specified in this document. clients MUST reject urls with an unrecognized version. it is RECOMMENDED that every value of u is recognized by every server s. if a client encounters an error when downloading from one server, it SHOULD try downloading from another server. clients SHOULD NOT use rtp urls in OPEN requests, instead they should choose a value listed in u. unrecognized fields SHOULD be ignored. gemini+rtp use the Gemini Protocol in order to implement mutable identifiers. gemini is used in \u201cproxy mode\u201d, that is, the sent url has a scheme of gemini+rtp and not gemini. the gemini server then uses a cross-protocol redirect to return an rtp url. Rationale READ.length is defined as a maximum so that clients that do not know the length of the resource they are downloading can use a value of 2^64 - 1 to request as much of the rest of the resource as the server is able to provide. READ.offset exists both so that downloads can be resumed, and also to allow seeking within complex formats (eg. allowing you do download just one file out of a zip archive). It also allows doing swarm downloads from multiple equally trusted sources. Appendix A: error strings an error string consists of a machine readable string representing the kind of error, optionally followed by a colon, and then a human-readable string further clarifying the error. the following predefined error strings: * error: a generic error kind usable when nothing else is applicaple * not found: no resource with the given uri is known to the server. * unsupported scheme: the given uri or urn scheme is not supported #networking #programming",

    "content": "Unification is formal methods speak for solving equations. The most common form of unification discussed is first order syntactic unification. When it succeeds, it solves a pile of equations no matter what the actual functions represent. [exists ?X ?Y] foo(bar(?X)) = foo(?Y) has a solution [forall ?Y ?X] ?Y = bar(?X). Or cos(sin(?X)) = cos(?Y) has a solution ?Y = sin(?X). From the perspective of first order unification, it doesn\u2019t matter what cos and sin mean. Actually implementing unification, similar to most other algorithms that manipulate variables, is kind of the bane of my existence. I avoid it at extreme cost. It is somewhat surprising that unification is cleaner and easier to implement in an loopy imperative mutational style than in a recursive functional pure style. Typically theorem proving / mathematical algorithms are much cleaner in the second style in my subjective opinion. Unification has too much spooky action at a distance, a threaded state, and can usefully use access to the stack in the form a todo queue to canonize it or reorder it. A recursion form can be convenient if you need to rebuild a term after you\u2019re done doing whatever you\u2019re doing. In the manual todo list form, you\u2019ll need to store a zipper of some kind to replicate that. Unification typically only returns a substitution and not the original inputs terms specialized to the substitution (although this would be useful for critical pairs, narrowing etc). So for unification, this benefit of recursion is not so useful. Pattern Matching Unification can be seen as two sided pattern matching. Pattern matching (like python\u2019s new match-case construct) takes in some tree and allows you to match it against patterns. Patterns maybe contain variables, and when the pattern matches, that branch of the case has the variables bound. Unification allows you to match patterns against patterns. In one possible low level implementation, the variables are refcells. Unification works via pointer manipulation, pointing the refcell to a piece of a tree or another refcell. It\u2019d be neat and possible for a low level language like rust to support pointer based unification as something akin to a match statement. In logic programming languages, we typically have both unification and backtracking. These aren\u2019t intrinsically coupled features. Anyway, pattern matching is much easier to implement. Let\u2019s take a look to make a point about recursive vs iterative implementations. Like many algorithms, there is a recursive and iterative version. The iterative version more or less reifies the call stack of the recursive version into a normal data structure, keeping around a queue of thins to do. You can also choose whether to manipulate the substitution you\u2019re building purely functionally or mutationally. # I'm going to work over the z3py ast, because it's useful for knuckledragger and it avoids defining some arbitrary ast. from z3 import * def pmatch(pat, t): subst = {} def worker(pat, t): if is_var(pat): if pat in subst: return subst[pat].eq(t) else: subst[pat] = t return True if is_app(pat): if is_app(t) and pat.decl() == t.decl(): return all(worker(pat.arg(i), t.arg(i)) for i in range(pat.num_args())) return False if worker(pat, t): return subst # I'm sort of abusing z3's Var here. It's meant for de bruijn vars x,y,z = Var(0,IntSort()), Var(1,IntSort()), Var(2,IntSort()) assert pmatch(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {} assert pmatch(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None assert pmatch(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)} assert pmatch(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == None assert pmatch(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)} assert pmatch(x + y, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == {x : IntVal(3), y : IntVal(4)} But we can also write this in a loopy todo list form. from z3 import * def pmatch_loop(pat, t): subst = {} todo = [(pat, t)] while todo: pat, t = todo.pop() if is_var(pat): if pat in subst: if not subst[pat].eq(t): return None else: subst[pat] = t elif is_app(pat): if not is_app(t) or pat.decl() != t.decl(): return None todo.extend(zip(pat.children(), t.children())) return subst assert pmatch_loop(IntVal(3), IntVal(3)) == {} assert pmatch_loop(IntVal(3), IntVal(4)) == None assert pmatch_loop(x, IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)} assert pmatch_loop(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == None assert pmatch_loop(x + x, IntVal(3) + IntVal(3)) == {x : IntVal(3)} assert pmatch_loop(x + y, IntVal(3) + IntVal(4)) == {x : IntVal(3), y : IntVal(4)} Inference Rules to the Loop Unification can be presented as an inference system. Inference rules as compared to pseudocode are nice sometimes. They make things feel mathier. They can make it clear that there is choice available on how to proceed. If you know prolog, rules are cool in that you can write them down as prolog clauses. The huge downsides of inference rules is that they are a barrier to entry, and the leap from rules to any sort of implementable algorithm can be very non trivial. If I write unification with a LIFO queue, FIFO queue or some other ordering, it doesn\u2019t matter much. And this can matter in more complex unification domains (E-unification and higher order unification) where you can get locally stumped on how to proceed, so it can be fruitful to pick off of you todo list the easiest to solve equation. from TRAAT chapter 4 delete remove a trivial equation, decompose matches heads and then zips together their children, orient puts variables in the lhs, eliminate takes an equation in solved for and substitues the solution everywhere. A todo queue is basically our multiset S and we choose a particular order to process the equations. We end up with something like this. def occurs(x, t): if is_var(t): return x.eq(t) if is_app(t): return any(occurs(x, t.arg(i)) for i in range(t.num_args())) return False def unify(p1,p2): subst = {} todo = [(p1,p2)] while todo: p1,p2 = todo.pop() # we could pop _any_ of the todos, not just the top. if p1.eq(p2): # delete continue elif is_var(p1): # elim if occurs(p1, p2): return None todo = [(substitute(t1,(p1,p2)), substitute(t2,(p1,p2))) for (t1,t2) in todo] subst = {k : substitute(v, (p1,p2)) for k,v in subst.items()} subst[p1] = p2 elif is_var(p2): # orient todo.append((p2,p1)) elif is_app(p1): # decompose if not is_app(p2) or p1.decl() !=",

    "content": "The Supergraph Manifesto #Supergraph is an architecture framework that offers reference architectures, design guidelines/principles and an operating model to help multiple teams to collaborate on a self-serve platform for federated data access, API integration/composition or GraphQL APIs. An implementation artifact of the Supergraph architecture is called a supergraph (lowercase s).When a supergraph is built with a GraphQL federation stack, the engine is often called a gateway or a router and the subgraph connectors are often GraphQL services.A supergraph is typically used for the following 2 use-cases:Self-serve API composition platform: A self-serve operating model for API integration, orchestration & aggregationFederated data access layer: A federated data layer that allows realtime access to data sources with cross-domain composability (joins, filtering etc.) Related: Data mesh, data productsStrategy and Core concepts #A supergraph approach aims to build a flywheel of data access and supply to incrementally improve self-service access to data and APIs.I. CONNECT domains #Domain owners (or data owners, or API producers) should be able to seamlessly connect their domains to the platform. A major challenge in building supergraph is the resistance to change by the domain owners. They often oppose having to build, operate and maintain another API layer, such as a GraphQL server that creates another wrapper on their domain. This reluctance and concern is understandable and completely valid and must be systematically addressed by the supergraph platform strategy and the supergraph reference architecture.This has two main implications for the subgraph connector\u2019s lifecycle and runtime:Subgraph connector CI/CD: As domain owners change their domains, the API contract published via the supergraph engine, must stay in sync with the least amount of overhead for the domain owner. The SDLC, change-management or CI/CD process of the domain owners must involve updating their API contract (eg: versioning), prevent breaking changes and keeping documentation up to date.Subgraph connector performance: The subgraph connector must not reduce performance as compared to what is provided by accessing the underlying domain directly. API performance characteristics as measured by latency, payload size & concurrency.Guaranteeing a smooth CI/CD process and high-performance connectivity gives domain owners confidence that they can connect their domains to the supergraph platform and iterate on changes to their domains fearlessly.This unlocks self-serve connectivity for domain owners.II. CONSUME APIs #API consumers should be able to discover and consume APIs in a way that doesn\u2019t require manual API integration, aggregation or composition effort as far as possible. API consumers have several common needs when they\u2019re dealing with fixed API endpoints or specific data queries:fetch different projections of data to prevent over-fetchingjoin data from multiple places to prevent under-fetchingfilter, paginate, sort and aggregate data from multiple placesTo provide an API experience that makes the consumption experience truly self-serve, there are two key requirements:Composable API design: The API presented by the supergraph engine must allow for on-demand composability. GraphQL is a great API to express composability semantics, but regardless of the API format used, a standardized, composable API design is a critical requirement.API portal: High-quality search, discovery and documentation of both the API and the underlying API models is critical to enable self-serve consumption. The more information that can be made available to API consumers the better. Eg: Data lineage, Authorization policies etc as appropriate.This unlocks self-serve consumption for API consumersIII. DISCOVER demand #Understanding how API consumers use their domain and identify their unmet needs is crucial for API producers. This insight allows API producers to enhance their domain. It also helps discover new domain owners to connect their domain into the supergraph.This necessitates 2 key capabilities of the supergraph platform to create a consumer-first, agile culture:API consumption, API schema & portal analytics: A supergraph is analogous to a marketplace and needs to provide the marketplace owners and producers with insights to help improve the marketplace for the consumers.Ecosystem integrations: The supergraph platform should be able to integrate with existing communication and catalog tools, in particular to help understand unmet demand of API consumers.This closes the loop and allows the supergraph platform to create a virtuous cycle of success for producers and consumers.Architecture guide #CI/CD and build system (control plane) #The control plane of the supergraph is critical to help domain owners connect their domains to the supergraph.There are 3 components in the control plane of the supergraphThe domain itselfThe subgraphThe supergraphThe control plane should define the following SDLC to help keep the supergraph in sync with the domain as the underlying domain changes.Distributed data plane #The supergraph data plane is critical to enable high performance access to upstream domains so that API producers can maintain their domain without hidden future maintenance costs:API schema design guide #Standardization #A supergraph API schema should create standardized conventions on the following:Standardization AttributeCapabilityS1Separating models (resources) & commands (methods) ExampleModels are collections of data that can be queried in standardized source-agnostic ways (eg: resources)Commands are methods that map to particular pieces of business logic that might return references to other commands or models(eg: methods) # A standardized way to fetch a list of authors query GetAuthors { authors { id name } } # A specific method to search for authors query findAuthors { search_authors(args: {search: \"Einstein\"}) { id name } } S2Model filteringExampleGet a list of articles published this year query articlesThisYear { articles(where: {publishDate: {_gt: \"2024-01-01\"}}) { id name } } S3Model sortingExampleGet a list of articles sorted in reverse by the date of publishingquery sortedArticles { article(order_by: {publishDate: desc}) { id title author_id } } S4Model paginationExamplePaginate the above list with 20 objects per page and fetch the 3rd pagequery sortedArticlesThirdPage { article(order_by: {publishDate: desc}, offset: 40, limit: 20) { id title author_id } } S5Model aggregations over fieldsExampleGet a count of authors and their average agequery authorStatistics { author_aggregate { aggregate { count # basic aggregation support by any model avg { # supported over any numeric fields of a type age } } } } Prior artGoogle Cloud API design guideResource: A resource-oriented API is generally modeled as a resource hierarchy, where each node is either a simple resource or a collection",

This is what it should look like: Here's how it works. CSS allows us to change the icon displayed by a cursor. There are dozens of built-in icons, but you can also supply your own image file. CSS#link { cursor: url(\"/path/to/image.png\"), auto; } Anything hovering over that link will get that .png as its cursor. Nifty! Most websites have a Favicon - it is a little image that you see in your browser bar, or when you save a website to your favourites. It is usually found at /favicon.ico - but can be in a variety of places. There are dozens of free and paid services which let you quickly grab a favicon from any site. The one I tend to use is DuckDuckGo's service. It takes any domain name, like Google.com, and returns an icon. It looks like this https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip9/google.com.ico You can put the CSS anywhere - including inline with your links: HTML<a href=\"https://google.com/\" style='cursor:url(\"https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip9/google.com.ico\"), auto;' >Visit this website</a>! Well\u2026 maybe? If you have lots of links to various destinations and don't want to clutter up your prose with \"(Wikipedia)\" or other things like that, it could be useful. Not everyone will recognise the logo for every service - so it may not add anything useful. It doesn't work on mobile. This isn't a common UI pattern - which might be a little confusing for users. Loading images from remote sites is probably not a security concern. But if a website is hacked, you might have unwanted images on your site. A site could lie to you about its destination. Automating it should be possible, but it could be a bit of a faff to maintain. But it looks so pretty!",

    "content": "Bryan Braun has an interesting post about his experience with what he calls a \u201chaunted domain\u201d: He buys a domain that seems fine on the surface. When he begins using it, he notices some things aren\u2019t right (organic search traffic, for example, is dead). After some investigation, he learns the domain was previously used to host pirated music. He has to ask himself: now what? Being able to ascertain the reputation and vitality of a domain is an intriguing problem. At a societal level, it\u2019s not really a problem we\u2019ve had to wrestle with (yet). Imagine, for example, 200 years from now when somebody is reading a well-researched book whose sources point to all kinds of domains online which at one point were credible sources but now are possibly gambling, porn, or piracy web sites. If you take the long view, we\u2019re still at the very beginning of the internet\u2019s history where buying a domain has traditionally meant you\u2019re buying \u201cnew\u201d. But what will happen as the lifespan of a domain begins to outpace us humans? You\u2019re going to want to know where your domain has been. The \u201ccondition\u201d of a domain could very well become a million dollar industry with experts. Similar to how we have CARFAX vehicle history reports, domain history reports could become standard fare when purchasing a domain. In fact, parallels to other real-world purchase verification and buyer protection programs is intriguing. Car Titles Establishing legal ownership of a vehicle through titles is something the government participates in. You\u2019ll often hear people advertise a used vehicle as having a \u201cclean title\u201d, meaning it doesn\u2019t have a salvaged or rebuilt title (which indicates a history of damage). But how the car was used is also important. Was the car part of a fleet, e.g. a rental car? Was it owned by a private third-party its whole life? Did that person drive Uber? So. Many. Questions. Even where the car has been is important. I remember buying a car in Las Vegas once and the dealer was telling me how people from New England frequently fly into town to buy a car. Why? Because they want a car whose lifespan had been in the dry desert and would thus be free of the effects of harsh winters (rust from snow/salted roads, etc). Houses When you buy a house, getting an inspection is pretty standard fare (where I live). Part of the home buying process includes paying an inspector to come in and assess the state of the home \u2014 and hopefully find any problems the current owners either don\u2019t know about or are keeping from you. But the history of the home is often important too. Was it a drug house? Was it a rental? An Airbnb? Houses have interesting parallels to domains because their lifespans are so much longer than other things like cars (my current house was built in the 1930\u2019s). Homes can go through many owners, some of whom improve it over time while others damage it. You know those home renovation shows? The nerd version of that would be a \u201cdomain renovation\u201d show where people buy old domains, fix them up (get them whitelisted with search engines again, build lots of reputable inbound links, etc.), and then flip them for a good price. Collector Items (Cards, Books, Toys, etc.) What I love most about this world is the verbiage around the various grading systems, such as: Mint Near mint Excellent Very good Good Fair Poor Damaged Even within \u201cMint\u201d there are various categorizations such as: MIB: Mint In Box MOC: Mint On Card (still has the OG tags) FM: Factory Mint Can you imagine something similar for domains? MNR: Mint, Never Registered MNPT: Mint, No Public Traffic MNB: Mint, No Backlinks Conclusion Honestly, I don\u2019t really have anything else to say about this, lol. It\u2019s simply fun to think about and write down what comes to mind. That said, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if a standardized grading system with institutional verification rises up around the world of domains. URLs are everywhere \u2014 from official government records to scrawled on the back a door in a public restroom \u2014 and they\u2019ll be embedded in civilization for years to come. (Even more so if domains become the currency of online handles!) Today usa.gov is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. But a few hundred years from now, who knows? Maybe it\u2019ll be an index for pirated music. Whatever happened to romanempire.gov?",

    "content": "A year ago we went through of process of getting every test case in our project tagged with t.Parallel and ratcheted with paralleltest. I was initially skeptical about this being worth the effort because testing across Go packages was already happening in parallel, but it turned out to be a major boon for running large packages individually where we reduced test time by 30%+. We did one more step from there to tag every subtest with t.Parallel too. The gains from that weren\u2019t as big, but it helps when running tests with many subtests one off, and isn\u2019t much effort to sustain now that it\u2019s in place. We\u2019re running close to 5,000 tests at this point. Large scale code refactoring tools aren\u2019t widespread in Go, so I did most of the refactoring with some very gnarly multi-line regexes, and even with those, the only reason that it was possible was that we\u2019re obsessive with keeping strong code convention. Most test cases were structured with an identical layout, which might\u2019ve seemed like unnecessary pedantry when it was first going in, but later paid off in reams as I refactored thousands of tests in hours instead of weeks. Let me showcase a test convention that we\u2019ve found to be useful for making subtests parallel-safe, keeping them DRY (unlike many languages, Go doesn\u2019t have built-in facilities for setup/teardown blocks in tests), and keeping code readable. I try to be honest in the assessment of programming conventions and am not always certain about new ones, but we\u2019ve been using the parallel test bundle for months and I\u2019d rate it a 10\u204410 strong recommendation. Better yet, it\u2019s all just plain Go code and doesn\u2019t require the adoption of anything weird/novel. The test bundle itself is simple struct containing the object under test and useful fixtures to have available across subtests: type testBundle struct { account *dbsqlc.Account svc *playgroundTutorialService team *dbsqlc.Team tx db.Tx } It\u2019s paired with a setup helper function that returns a bundle: setup := func(t *testing.T) (*testBundle, context.Context) { t.Helper() // These two vars are standard across almost every test case. var ( ctx = ptesting.Context(t) tx = ptesting.TestTx(ctx, t) ) // Group of data fixtures. var ( team = dbfactory.Team(ctx, t, tx, &dbfactory.TeamOpts{}) account = dbfactory.Account(ctx, t, tx, &dbfactory.AccountOpts{}) _ = dbfactory.AccessGroupAccount_Admin(ctx, t, tx, team.ID, account.ID) ) ctx = authntest.Account(account).Context(ctx) return &testBundle{ account: account, svc: pservicetest.InitAndStart(ctx, t, NewPlaygroundTutorialService(), tx.Begin, nil), team: team, tx: tx, }, ctx } Along with a test bundle, the function also returns a context , which is useful for seeding context with a context logger that makes sure all logging output is collated with the test being run instead of stdout where its output would be interleaved with that of other tests running parallel. Tests that don\u2019t need a context omit the second return value. Each subtest marks itself as parallel, and calls setup to procure a test bundle: t.Run(\"AllProperties\", func(t *testing.T) { t.Parallel() bundle, ctx := setup(t) ... Each instance of a test bundle is fully insulated from every other instance, ensuring that no side effects from a test can leak into any other. Every test case uses a test transaction so that it\u2019s got its own private snapshot into the database for purposes of raising fixtures or querying. We tend to put test bundles in every test case, even where the bundle contains only a single field. This is a courtesy to a future developer who might need to augment the test and where a preexisting test bundle makes that faster to do. It also keeps convention strong in case we need to do another broad refactor down the line. Here\u2019s a full code sample with all the steps together: func TestPlaygroundTutorialServiceCreate(t *testing.T) { t.Parallel() type testBundle struct { account *dbsqlc.Account svc *playgroundTutorialService team *dbsqlc.Team tx db.Txer } setup := func(t *testing.T) (*testBundle, context.Context) { t.Helper() var ( ctx = ptesting.Context(t) tx = ptesting.TestTx(ctx, t) ) var ( team = dbfactory.Team(ctx, t, tx, &dbfactory.TeamOpts{}) account = dbfactory.Account(ctx, t, tx, &dbfactory.AccountOpts{}) _ = dbfactory.AccessGroupAccount_Admin(ctx, t, tx, team.ID, account.ID) ) ctx = authntest.Account(account).Context(ctx) return &testBundle{ account: account, svc: pservicetest.InitAndStart(ctx, t, NewPlaygroundTutorialService(), tx.Begin, nil), team: team, tx: tx, }, ctx } t.Run(\"AllProperties\", func(t *testing.T) { t.Parallel() bundle, ctx := setup(t) resp, err := pservicetest.InvokeHandler(bundle.svc.Create, ctx, &PlaygroundTutorialCreateRequest{ BootstrapSQL: ptrutil.Ptr(`SELECT unnest(array[1,2,3]);`), Name: \"My playground tutorial\", Content: \"# My tutorial\\n\\nThis is my SQL tutorial, created by **me**.\", IsPinned: true, IsPublic: true, TeamID: eid.EID(bundle.team.ID), Weight: ptrutil.Ptr(int32(100)), }) require.NoError(t, err) prequire.PartialEqual(t, &apiresourcekind.PlaygroundTutorial{ BootstrapSQL: ptrutil.Ptr(`SELECT unnest(array[1,2,3]);`), Content: \"# My tutorial\\n\\nThis is my SQL tutorial, created by **me**.\", IsPinned: true, IsPublic: true, Name: \"My playground tutorial\", TeamID: eid.EID(bundle.team.ID), Weight: ptrutil.Ptr(int32(100)), }, resp) _, err = dbsqlc.New().PlaygroundTutorialGetByID(ctx, bundle.tx, uuid.UUID(resp.ID)) require.NoError(t, err) prequire.EventForActor(ctx, t, bundle.tx, \"playground_tutorial.created\", bundle.account.ID) }) } See also the PartialEqual helper which I wasn\u2019t completely sure about when I first put it in, but am now fully bought into now because it\u2019s shown itself to be so effective at keeping many consecutive assertions very tidy.",

    "content": "The Go compiler skips files ending with _test.go during normal compilation. They are compiled with go test command (together will all other .go files), which also inserts some chutney to run the test functions. The standard way to do testing is to have a foo.go and foo_test.go file next to each other. If you have a file that appears to end with _test.go but doesn\u2019t actually end with _test.go, then it will get compiled for a regular build. For example: U+FE0E is a variation selector. These are typically very invisible. Or more traditional homoglyph trickery: Those Cyrillic letters appear virtually identical on my machine: b_t\u0435\u0455t.go / b_test.go, or as monospace: b_t\u0435\u0455t.go / b_test.go. This can also be done with zero-width space, zero-width joiner, and perhaps a few other codepoints, but variation selectors tend to be the \u201cmost invisible\u201d of them. This is pretty sneaky, something like this: var bcryptCost = bcrypt.DefaultCost func hashPassword(pwd []byte) []byte { pwd, _ := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword(pwd, bcryptCost) return pwd } func init() { bcryptCost = bcrypt.MinCost } Is perfectly valid, but with a doctored \u201cnon-test\u201d user_test.go it will now lower the security of all passwords, and effectively inserts a backdoor. There are many variants one can think of: code that looks innocent and would probably pass many reviews, but will backdoor the codebase by weakening the security, or adds in \u201ctest users\u201d, \u201ctest keys\u201d, \u201cdefault passwords\u201d, and things like that. Who is carefully auditing tests for security in the first place? I\u2019ve audited a bunch of packages over the years, but I\u2019ve never paid much attention to the test files. Most tools don\u2019t display this: Vim, VSCode, macOS finder, Windows Explorer, /bin/ls, GitHub, GitLab, etc. \u2013 they all just display user_test.go with no indication there\u2019s something more there. Take a look at the test repo; all seems fairly innocent. Arguably, that\u2019s how it should be, at least for some of these programs. Variation selectors are a Unicode feature and required to display certain types of text. That said, filenames are not really \u201cnormal text\u201d, certainly not in the context of code. The major exception is the git CLI with core.quotePath=true (the default), which displays the byte sequences for anything that\u2019s not ASCII. You need to enable that setting to have any non-ASCII path display correctly, and depending on locality it\u2019s probably a somewhat common setting. And how many people use the git CLI to review files (instead of GitHub web UI, VSCode integration, etc?) I\u2019m a pretty heavy git CLI user, but typically don\u2019t use \u201cgit diff\u201d or \u201cgit log\u201d for viewing differences between releases, and even if I did, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019d miss this in a \u201cgit diff\u201d. Another way to detect this is to carefully pay attention to the URL in e.g. GitHub when viewing files, which displays escapes for some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the variants. But this isn\u2019t displayed in the PR view, only when browsing files, and is very easy to miss. I reported this to GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket back in June. None of them considered this to be a security issue. I don\u2019t really understand why, because it doesn\u2019t seem too dissimilar to LTR trickery to hide code. Also GitHub will display a warning for PRs with this sort of trickery: The head ref may contain hidden characters: \"a\\uFE0Eb\" Crafted branch names is an issue but crafted files are not? Well okay \ud83e\udd37 Also emailed the security@golang.org, but they never got back to me, so I guess they don\u2019t consider it an issue either. Is it viable to do a real-world attack with this? I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t tried. I am not employed at the University of Minnesota so I don\u2019t go around sending malicious patches just to see what would happen. But if I were tasked to Jia Tan a Go codebase, this seems a promising method. There\u2019s very little obfuscation and with a bit of careful design from a malicious actor everything can seem legitimate test code that\u2019s there for valid reasons, being only malicious because it gets compiled in the regular program, and because it still gets compiled in the test program the tests will still work. Seems like a great way to hide malicious code in plain sight. Doing a full Jia Tan and compromising ssh is still tricky, because that requires doing the sort of stuff that typically has no business being in a test file. That\u2019s why in xz it was hidden in binary test data. Still, with the right project and a bit of creativity I could envision this as a step in a similar scheme, especially when done by the maintainer itself.

    "content": "Concurrency is really, really difficult for humans to reason about. TLA+ itself was borne out of Leslie Lamport\u2019s frustration with the difficulty of write error-free concurrent algorithms: When I first learned about the mutual exclusion problem, it seemed easy and the published algorithms seemed needlessly complicated. So, I dashed off a simple algorithm and submitted it to CACM. I soon received a referee\u2019s report pointing out the error. This had two effects. First, it made me mad enough at myself to sit down and come up with a real solution. The result was the bakery algorithm described in [12]. The second effect was to arouse my interest in verifying concurrent algorithms. Modeling concurrency control in database systems is a great use case for TLA+, so I decided to learn use TLA+ to learn more about database isolation. This post is about modeling serializability. You can find all of the the TLA+ models referenced in this post in my snapshot-isolation-tla repo. This post isn\u2019t about snapshot isolation at all, so think of the name as a bit of foreshadowing of a future blog post, which we\u2019ll discuss at the end. Modeling a database for reasoning about transaction isolation In relational databases, data is modeled as rows in different tables, where each table has a defined set of named columns, and there are foreign key relationships between the tables. However, when modeling transaction isolation, we don\u2019t need to worry about those details. For the purpose of a transaction, all we care about is if any of the columns of a particular row are read or modified. This means we can ignore details about tables, columns, and relations. All we care about are the rows. The transaction isolation literature talks about objects instead of rows, and that\u2019s the convention I\u2019m going to use. Think of an object like a variable that is assigned a value, and that assignment can change over time. A SQL select statement is a read, and a SQL update statement is a write. An example of how we\u2019re modeling the database Note that the set of objects is fixed during the lifetime of the model, it\u2019s only the values that change over time. I\u2019m only going to model reads and writes, but it\u2019s simple enough to extend this model to support creation and deletion by writing a tombstone value to model deletion, and having a not-yet-created-stone value to model an object that has not yet been created in the database. I\u2019ll use the notation r[obj, val] to refer to a read operation where we read the object obj and get the value val and w[obj, val] to mean where we write the value val to obj. So, for example, setting x=1 would be: w[x, 1], and reading the value of x as 1 would be r[x, 1]. I\u2019m going to use Obj to model the set of objects, and Val to model the set of possible values that objects can take on. Obj is the set of objects, Val is the set of values that can be assigned to objects We can model the values of the objects at any point in time as a function that maps objects to values. I\u2019ll call these sorts of functions environments (env for short) since that\u2019s what people who write interpreters call them. Example of an environment As an example of syntax, here\u2019s how we would assert in TLA+ that the variable env is a function that maps element of the set Obj to elements of the set Val: What is serializability? Here\u2019s how the SQL:1999 standard describes serializability (via the Jepsen serializability page): The execution of concurrent SQL-transactions at isolation level SERIALIZABLE is guaranteed to be serializable. A serializable execution is defined to be an execution of the operations of concurrently executing SQL-transactions that produces the same effect as some serial execution of those same SQL-transactions. A serial execution is one in which each SQL-transaction executes to completion before the next SQL-transaction begins. An execution history of reads and writes is serializable if it is equivalent to some other execution history where the committed transactions are scheduled serially (i.e., they don\u2019t overlap in time). Here\u2019s an example of a serializable execution history. Atul Adya famously came up with a formalism for database isolation levels (including serializability) in his PhD dissertation work, and published this in a paper co-authored by Barbara Liskov (his PhD advisor) and Patrick O\u2019Neil (an author of the original log-structured merge-tree paper and one of the co-authors of the paper A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels, which pointed out problems in the SQL specification\u2019s definitions of the isolation levels ). Specifying serializability Adya formalized database isolation levels by specifying dependencies between transactions. However, I\u2019m not going to use Adya\u2019s approach for my specification. Instead, I\u2019m going to use a state-based approach, like the one used by Natacha Crooks, Youer Pu, Lorenzo Alvisi and Allen Clement in their paper Seeing is Believing: A Client-Centric Specification of Database Isolation. It\u2019s important to remember that a specification is just a set of behaviors (series of state transitions). We\u2019re going to use TLA+ to define the set of all of the behaviors that we consider valid for serializability. Another way to put that is that our specification is the set of all serializable executions. We want to make sure that if we build an implementation, all of the behaviors permitted by the implementation are a subset of our serializability specification. Note: Causality is not required Here\u2019s an example of an execution history that is serializable according to the definition: This looks weird to us because the write happens after the read: T1 is reading data from the future! But the definition of serializability places no constraints on the ordering of the transaction, for that you need a different isolation level: strict serializability. But we\u2019re modeling serializability, not strict serializability, so we allow histories like the one above in our specification. (I\u2019d say \u201cgood luck actually implementing a system that can read",

For example I tried to replace my phone default SMS app with Google Messages for Web \u2026 but I really did not liked the experience.

You may also check the SCRCPY GitHub page for some additional information. Android Settings You need to set several things on your Android device. First go to About Phone in the Settings. Then click Software Information there. Then you will have to tap the Build Number at least 7 times. You will then see floating information that the Developer Mode is enabled. Now \u2013 get back to main Settings screen and choose Developer Options there. Make sure that the Developer Options are in On state. Not needed for this to work \u2013 but you may want to enable Stay Awake option so your phone will not automatically lock when its attached to USB cable \u2013 useful with SCRCPY tool. You will need to enable USB Debugging as shown below. You can also set in which USB mode your phone is ready after attaching it with USB cable in Default USB Configuration. For the remove SCRCPY operation the Transferring Files option is needed. Now you Android device configuration is complete.

Tap the \u2018gear\u2019 icon in your current WiFi connection. \u2026 and below in the details you fill find the Android device IP address along with its MAC address. I also added that MAC address of my Android device in the DHCP configuration and assigned it to the 10.0.0.33 IP address \u2013 that will be useful later \u2013 for the script that automates connecting to the Android device.

I really liked how approachable Meson\u2019s build rules where, and also that it supported projects composed of multiple languages. This is useful to me as parts of my toolchain for handling assets, and converting them to a format usable on the Game Boy, are written in higher level languages. If I change the code of part of that toolchain, the build system knows what assets need to processed and what parts of the game need to be relinked, automatically.There\u2019s just one problem: Meson doesn\u2019t support the Game Boy. However, that\u2019s never stopped me before!Technology is incredible!I\u2019ve created a fork of Meson that adds support for using RGBDS to assemble and link Game Boy games. This was surprisingly easy to do, which is a testament for both the Meson and RGBDS projects. In Meson I added a new \u201clanguage\u201d rgbds which sets up rgbasm as the compiler/assembler and rgblink as the linker. A ROM can be built just by calling the executable function.project('rgbds-test', 'rgbds') executable('rgbdstest.gb', 'src/main.asm', include_directories: ['include'], link_language: 'rgbds') Then Meson can be initialized to assemble to the Game Boy\u2019s CPU and the game built.

Since this header contains two checksums, usually it\u2019s configured using the rgbfix tool rather than being hardcoded in assembly. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t figured out a good way for executable to automatically call this tool with the correct parameters after the rom is linked, but the tool can be invoked as a custom_target.project('rgbds-test', 'rgbds') rgbfix = find_program('rgbfix', required: true) rom = executable('rgbdstest', 'src/main.asm', include_directories: ['include'], link_language: 'rgbds') custom_target(output: 'rgbdstest.gb', input: rom, command: [ rgbfix, '--title', 'EXAMPLE', '--old-licensee', '0x33', '--mbc-type', 'ROM', '--rom-version', '0', '--non-japanese', '--validate', '-', ], build_by_default: true, capture: true, feed: true) This example also showcases using custom_target to interact with tools that need to be \u201cfeed\u201d via stdin and where the results need to be \u201ccaptured\u201d on stdout, which is convenient as otherwise rgbfix edits the file in-place, which could cause issues later.Since I\u2019m not ready to release my game just yet, I\u2019ve modified pokered to use my fork of Meson. This builds the two image converters written in C, converts all the images to a format suitable for the Game Boy, and assembles and links with RGBDS.

I\u2019ve created a \u201crgbds\u201d module which has a function run rgbfix to patch the ROM header, instead of needing to implement the above custom_target yourself.rgbds = import('rgbds') rgbds.fix('rgbdstest.gb', rom, title: 'EXAMPLE', mbc_type: 'ROM', fix_spec: 'lhg') This module also adds a function with a barebones implementation of rgbgfx, the graphics converter from the RGBDS project. This was previously implemented as a custom_target in the pokered fork above.pngs = [ 'bug', 'plant', 'snake', 'quadruped', ] foreach f : pngs gen = custom_target(output: '@0@_conv.png'.format(f), input: '@0@.png'.format(f), command: [rgbgfx, '-o', '@OUTPUT@', '@INPUT@']) gfx += custom_target(output: '@0@.2bpp'.format(f), input: gen, command: [tools_gfx, '-o', '@OUTPUT@', '@INPUT@']) endforeach The inner for loop can now use the rgbds module.pngs = [ 'bug', 'plant', 'snake', 'quadruped', ] foreach f : pngs gen = rgbds.gfx('@0@_conv.2bpp'.format(f), '@0@.png'.format(f)) gfx += custom_target(output: '@0@.2bpp'.format(f), input: gen, command: [tools_gfx, '-o', '@OUTPUT@', '@INPUT@']) endforeach The meson branch of my pokered fork has been updated with these changes.",

    "content": "In this post I discuss how to use a new Git rebasing feature, --update-refs, which was included in Git 2.38, in October 2022. This makes working with \"stacked\" branches a lot easier. I'm a big fan of small git commits. Especially when you're creating a big feature. I like to create a \"story\" with my commits, adding bits of a larger feature commit by commit. The idea is to make it as simple as possible for others to review by walking through a commit at a time. As an extension to that, I often create separate PRs for each couple of commits in a feature. This, again, is to make it easier for people to review. GitHub's PR review pages really don't cope well with large PRs, even if you have \"incremental\" commits. Creating separate branches and PRs for each unit of functionality makes it easier for people to consume and follow the \"story\" of the commits. This approach, where you have lots of separate branches/PRs which build on top of one another, is called stacked branches/PRs. This makes sense when you think of the git graph of the branches: each branch is \"stacked\" on top of the previous one. For example, in the following repo I have 6 commits as part of a feature, feature-xyz, and have broken those down into 3 logical units, with a branch for each. I can then create a PR for each of those branches: For the first PR, for branch andrew/feature-xyz/part-1, I would create a PR requesting to merge to dev (in this example). For the second PR, for branch andrew/feature-xyz/part-2, I would create a PR requesting to merge to andrew/feature-xyz/part-1, and for the part-3 branch the PR would request to merge into part-2: Each PR only includes the commits specific to that branch, which makes for a much nicer reviewing experience (IMO). Don't think that I just naturally perfectly segment these commits when creating the feature. I heavily rebase and edit the commits before creating a PR. This all works great, until someone actually reviews part-1 and requests changes. Then we run into the gnarly side of stacked branches. Let's imagine someone comments that I've missed something important in the part-1 branch. Great. I can check out that branch, make the change, commit, and push it. Now the git log looks something like the following: Argh, what a mess. It's no longer a \"stack\". If we want the part-2 and part-3 branches to include the PR Feedback commit (we almost certainly do), then we have to rebase the branches on top of part-1. I always rebase, and basically never merge. I find the constant criss-cross of merged branches really hard to reason about. This is flame-war territory though, so I'm not going to go into it any more than that! To rebase the part-2 and part-3 branches, we would have to run something like this: git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-2 git rebase HEAD~2 --onto andrew/feature-xyz/part-1 git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-3 git rebase HEAD~ --onto andrew/feature-xyz/part-2 After running these commands we're back to a nice stacked list But still, that's pretty arduous. There's a lot of finicky rebase commands to run there, you have to get the different \"base\" and --onto references right (they're different for each branch), and so it's (understandably) hard to convince people that this is a worthwhile endeavour. That's where --update-refs comes in. Git version 2.38 introduced a new option to the rebase command: --update-refs. As per the documentation, when set, this option will: Automatically force-update any branches that point to commits that are being rebased. Any branches that are checked out in a worktree are not updated in this way. So what does that mean? In this section I'll show a few scenarios, and how --update-refs can help in each case. Our PRs are looking good, but there has subsequently been a commit to the dev branch, and I need to incorporate that into all my branches by rebasing on top of the latest commit: Without --update-refs, this is a pain. Using the approach from the previous section, I would need to checkout part-1, work out how to rebase it correctly onto dev and then repeat for each branch in the stack. An alternative approach would be to rebase the \"top\" of the stack, part-3 on top of dev. We could then reset each of the branches to the \"correct\" commit in the newly-rebased branch, something like this: git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-3 git rebase dev git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-2 git reset 782b4db --hard git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-1 git reset 0d976a1 --hard This is essentially what --update-refs does, but it makes things a lot simpler; it rebases a branch, \"remembers\" where all the existing (local) branches point, and then resets them to the correct point afterwards. Instead of doing our manual rebasing of each branch, we can \"fix\" the above example by running: git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-3 git rebase dev --update-refs which prints: Switched to branch 'andrew/feature-xyz/part-3' Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/andrew/feature-xyz/part-3. Updated the following refs with --update-refs: refs/heads/andrew/feature-xyz/part-1 refs/heads/andrew/feature-xyz/part-2 As you can see, git has automatically updated the andrew/feature-xyz/part-1 and andrew/feature-xyz/part-2 branch when it rebased the part-3 branch. This is really handy for keeping multiple branches up to date with your main branch. Let's go back to the original scenario\u2014 the first PR, based on part-1 has changes, and we need to rebase part-2 and part-3 on top. The good news is that no matter how many branches we have stacked, we only need to run two commands: checkout the tip branch, and rebase: git checkout andrew/feature-xyz/part-3 git rebase andrew/feature-xyz/part-1 --update-refs This has multiple benefits: We only need to do a single rebase We don't need to use --onto and pick only the commits specific to each intermediate branch, or do any reset --hard. After running this command, the branches look as expected: You'll still need to checkout the intermediate branches and force-push them etc, but at least a big part of the work is done. In the final scenario, we have our stack of branches:",

    "content": "We're forking Flutter. This is why. Matt Carroll \u2022 October 27, 2024 Over the years, Flutter has attracted millions of developers who built user interfaces across every platform. Flutter began as a UI toolkit for mobile - iOS and Android, only. Then Flutter added support for web. Finally, Flutter expanded to Mac, Windows, and Linux. Across this massive expansion of scope and responsibility, the Flutter team has only marginally increased its size. To help expand Flutter's available labor, and accelerate development, we're creating a fork of Flutter, called Flock. Flutter's labor shortage Let's do some back-of-the-napkin math to appreciate the Flutter team's labor shortage. How many Flutter developers exist in the world, today? My guess is that it's on the order of 1,000,000 developers. The real number is probably higher, but one million should be reasonably conservative. How large is the Flutter team, today? Google doesn't publish this information, but my guess is that the team is about 50 people strong. That's 50 people serving the needs of 1,000,000. Doing a little bit of division, that means that every single member of the Flutter team is responsible for the needs of 20,000 Flutter developers! That ratio is clearly unworkable for any semblance of customer support. A labor shortage can always be fixed through hiring. However, due to company-wide issues at Google, the Flutter team's head count was frozen circa 2023, and then earlier in 2024 we learned of a small number of layoffs. It seems that the team may now be expanding again, through outsourcing, but we're not likely to see the Flutter team double or quadruple its size any time soon. To make matters worse, Google's corporate re-focus on AI caused the Flutter team to de-prioritize all desktop platforms. As we speak, the Flutter team is in maintenance mode for 3 of its 6 supported platforms. Desktop is quite possibly the greatest untapped value for Flutter, but it's now mostly stagnant. The cost of limited labor Limited labor comes at a great cost for a toolkit that has rapidly expanded its user base, along with its overall scope. With so few developers to work on tickets, many tickets linger in the backlog. They can easily linger for years, if they're ever addressed at all. By the time a member of the Flutter team begins to investigate a ticket, the ticket might be years old. At that point, the Flutter team developer typically asks for further information from the person who filed the ticket. In my experience, when this happens to me, I've long since stopped working with the client who had the initial issue. I've written hundreds of thousands of lines of code since then. I often don't even remember filing the issue, let alone the obscure details related to the original issue. The team can't fix the bug without information from me, and it's been too long for me to provide information to the team. So the bug gets buried for a future developer to rediscover. Timing isn't just an issue for eventually root causing and fixing bugs. It's also a major product problem. Imagine that you're the engineering director, or CTO of a company whose next release is blocked by some Flutter bug. What do you do if the team won't work on that bug for 2 years? Well, if it's a serious bug for your company, then you stop using Flutter. You don't have a choice. You need to keep moving forward. Your team doesn't know how to work on the Flutter framework, and the Flutter framework team is either unresponsive, or at least completely non-committal towards a fix. Oh well - can't use Flutter any more. Flutter won't survive if these kinds of experiences become common. Flutter has two very valuable qualities. First, it's open source, so any developer can see how any part of Flutter is implemented, and can even change it. Second, the Flutter framework is written in the same language as Flutter apps. Because of these two qualities, experienced Flutter app developers, and package developers can contribute to the Flutter framework. How many Flutter developers exist in the world today who are capable of contributing at a productive level to the Flutter framework? Conservatively, I would guess there are about 1,000 of them. In other words, there are at least 1,000 Flutter developers in the world who could conceivably be hired to the Flutter team, if the team wanted to hire that many developers. Remember that ratio of 1 Flutter team member per 20,000 developers? If every capable Flutter framework contributor in the world regularly contributed to Flutter, that ratio of 1:20,000 would drop to 1:1,000. That's still a big ratio, but it's much better than what it is now. Moreover, as more external contributors get comfortable submitting fixes and features to Flutter, they'll tend to help train others to do the same. Thus, the support ratio would continue to move in a better direction. Why not work directly with the Flutter team? If increased external contributions is the path to a better Flutter world, then why fork Flutter when everyone could just work directly with the Flutter team? It's a tempting proposition to setup a concerted effort to contribute directly to Flutter. After all, the Flutter team regularly touts the number of external contributions that it rolls into each release. According to the Flutter public relations effort, they'd love all those external contributions! But, sadly, trying to work with the Flutter team delivers a different reality. While some developers have had success working with the Flutter team, many other developers have found it frustrating, if not unworkable. There are, no doubt, a number of factors that contribute to this result. Different developers will experience different issues. But here are some of them: Limited review labor: The developers who don't have enough time to write code are the same developers tapped to review contributions. Therefore, it can take a long time for review or updates. The time crunch also seems to lend",

Android development  felt very brittle at the time. (I was an Android user at the time, and developing mobile applications during this period is actually what drove me to iOS. I could see my development pain reflected in many of the apps I used.)

One of my servers suddenly deciding to start sending SSH connections to the wider internet. This is usually a pretty strong indicator of malware compromise, and I had to act quickly if that was the case. Luckily, I\u2019ve worked in infosec for a while, and some years ago I even did some freelance work doing forensics and cleanup of infected servers.So, not completely out of my element, I was surprised when after an hour or two I found no evidence of anything happening out of the ordinary. It\u2019s always hard to prove a negative, but really, the machine was fine. No odd process, no filesystem modifications, no odd network traffic (as observed by the hypervisor, not by the server itself which happens to be a VM - just to be extra sure!). If it was a malware compromise incident, the malware would have been pretty stealthy, and that runs against the idea of it having been commanded to scan the internet - in general, a very loud and noticeable action.I turned to the regularly running services on the machine. This is my main datacenter-hosted server, and I run a bunch of distributed or federated services on there:Syncthing relay.Mastodon instance.Tor relay (not exit, internal node only).Matrix homeserver.After close inspection, the Tor relay does connect to a few other relays that are hosted on port 22, but that\u2019s a very limited set of IPs, and it doesn\u2019t include anything in the network that sent my ISP the abuse complaint. Unlikely candidate. I thought maybe Matrix or Mastodon could be abused to send commanded requests to arbitrary IP:port destinations, but logging for both indicated nothing of the sort was (visibly) happening. The Sidekiq queue for my Mastodon instance was also absent of any trace of this, when I\u2019d have expected to see e.g. retries queued if it was involved.What was happening there? Was the abuse complaint just bogus?The smoking gunThen, I noticed something in one of my tcpdump that was still running to monitor traffic involving port 22 on that server. I had originally ran tcpdump filtering on dst port 22, since this is what would show traffic originating from my server going to remote destinations. However, for some reason, I dropped that filter at some point, instead filtering not src host 195.201.9.37 instead (my server\u2019s IP). This is when this showed up:04:14:25.286063 IP 45.187.212.68.22 > 195.201.9.37.59639: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 41396686, win 0, length 0 04:14:25.291455 IP 107.152.7.33.22 > 195.201.9.37.39793: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 1391844539, win 0, length 0 04:14:25.322255 IP 107.91.78.158.22 > 195.201.9.37.48900: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 1434896088, win 65535, length 0 Something was in fact going on. But not at all what I was expecting. Turns out: no connections were coming out of my server and going to the port 22 of random machines. But some random internet machines were in fact sending me TCP reset packets.If you\u2019ve been around networking/infosec communities for a while, you might now be screaming: backscatter! Source IP spoofing! And yeah, this was my first thought too. Let\u2019s do a quick aside to go into what those things mean.IP spoofing on the internetTurns out, it\u2019s pretty trivial to send packets to various destinations on the Internet with a fake source IP address (of course, the destination IP needs to be correct, since it determines&mldr; the destination). Many ISPs adhere to the Best Current Practice (BCP) 38, which can be summarized by the following: \u201cif you peer with a network, you should only allow them to send IP packets using IP address you expect from them\u201d. Unfortunately, that filtering can often only be done early on in a packet\u2019s route to its destination. Once the packet gets to a large transit provider, their peers expect that provider to carry traffic from the whole internet to them, and thus are not able to do any meaningful filtering.Which means, if you just find one transit provider which doesn\u2019t do BCP38 filtering&mldr; you can send IP packets tagged with any source IP you want! And unfortunately, even though the origins of BCP38 date back to 1998&mldr; there are still network providers 25 years later that don\u2019t implement it. APNIC has a great article from last year on the subject.The consequences in practice shouldn\u2019t be too bad. TCP, QUIC, and generally anything using (d)TLS requires roundtrips, which can\u2019t happen when a source IP is spoofed. Spoofing the source IP means that you get to send a \u201cwrong\u201d packets, but the replies to that packet still get sent to the source IP you spoofed, the spoofer doesn\u2019t get to see them and process them. There are a few well known abuse vectors that rely on spoofing, such as reflection DDoS, but it\u2019s not usually a concern.Unless&mldr;Guessing the motiveLet\u2019s come back to my RST packets. The main hypothesis is that someone is using my source IP to send outbound connections to the port 22",

Who am I, and who is the audience for this article? I have been writing code for 36 years in a number of languages, but professionally focused on C-heavy computer game engines and Go/Python/JS web development. I am expecting readers to be similarly reasonably comfortable and productive working in large codebases, writing and debugging code in their chosen language, etc. I would give very different advice to novices who might want an AI to teach them programming concepts or write code for them that is way beyond their level! For me, the appeal of an AI copilot is in taking care of boilerplate and repetitive tasks for me so I can focus on the interesting logic for any given problem. I am also not especially interested in cranking out large quantities of code automatically; I am highly skeptical of \"lines of code written\" as an efficiency metric. I would prefer to spend less time writing the same amount of code and more time thinking through edge cases, maintainability, etc. So, without further ado: What is Cursor? Cursor is a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) which has Large Language Model (LLM) powered features integrated into the core UI. It is a proprietary product with a free tier and a subscription option; however, the pricing sheet doesn't cover what the actual subscriber benefits are and how they compare to competing products. I'll try to clarify that when discussing the features below based on my own understanding, but a quick summary: Tab completion: This is a set of proprietary fine-tuned models that both provide code completion in the editor, as well as navigate to the next recommended action, all triggered by the Tab key. Only available to subscribers. Inline editing: This is a chat-based interface for making edits to selected code with a simple diff view using a foundation model such as GPT or Claude. Available to free and paid users. Chat sidebar: This is also a chat-based interface for making larger edits in a sidebar view, allowing more room for longer discussion, code sample suggestions across multiple files, etc. using a foundation model such as GPT or Claude. Available to free and paid users. Composer: This is yet another chat-based interface specifically meant for larger cross-codebase refactors, generating diffs for multiple files that you can page through and approve, also using a foundation model such as GPT or Claude. Available to free and paid users. Tab completion While other LLM-powered coding tools focus on a chat experience, so far in my usage of Cursor it's the tab completion that fits most naturally into my day-to-day practice of coding and saves the most time. A lot of thought and technical research has apparently gone into this feature, so that it can not only suggest completions for a line, several lines, or a whole function, but it can also suggest the next line to go to for the next edit. What this amounts to is being able to make part of a change, and then auto-complete related changes throughout the entire file just by repeatedly pressing Tab. One way to use this is as a code refactoring tool on steroids. For example, suppose I have a block of code with variable names in under_score notation that I want to convert to camelCase. It is sufficient to rename one instance of one variable, and then tab through all the lines that should be updated, including the other related variables. Many tedious, error-prone tasks can be automated in this way without having to write a script to do so: Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a link to the video instead. Sometimes tab completion will indepedently find a bug and propose a fix. Many times it will suggest imports when I add a dependency in Python or Go. If I wrap a string in quotes, it will escape the contents appropriately. And, as with other tools, it can write whole functions based on just the function signature and optional docstring: Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a link to the video instead. All in all, this tool feels like it is reading my mind, guessing at my next action, and allowing me to think less about the code and more about the architecture of I am building. Also worth noting: The completions are incredibly fast, and I never felt a delay waiting for a suggestion. They appear basically as soon as I stop typing. Having too long a wait would surely be a deal-breaker for me. So, what are my complaints with Tab completion? One is a minor annoyance: Sometimes I don't see the suggestion in time and continue typing, and the completion disappears. Once it is gone, there doesn't appear to be any way to get it to come back, so I have to type something else and hope. My other complaint is the exact opposite situation: Sometimes a completion is dead wrong, and I intentionally dismiss it. Subsequently, but very infrequently, I will accept a totally different completion and the previously-declined suggestion will quietly be applied as well. This has already caused",

    "content": "This isn't click bait. We really did this! We work in a very large Javascript monorepo at Microsoft we colloquially call 1JS. It's large not only in terms of GB, but also in terms of sheer volume of code and contributions. We recently crossed the 1,000 monthly active users mark, about 2,500 packages, and ~20million lines of code! The most recent clone I did of the repo clocked in at an astonishing 178GB.For many reasons, that's just too big, we have folks in Europe that can't even clone the repo due to it's size.The question is, how did this even happen?!Lesson #1 When I first joined the repo a few years ago, I noticed after a few months that it was growing, when I first cloned it was a gig or 2, but after a few months was already at around 4gb. It was hard to know exactly why.Back then I ran a tool called git-sizer , and it told me a few things about some blobs that were large. Large blobs happens when someone accidentally checks in some binary, so, not much you can do there other than enforce size limits on check ins which is a feature of Azure DevOps. Retroactively, once the file is there though, it's semi stuck in history. Secondly, it flagged me about our Beachball change files, which we weren't deleting. We use them in the same way that Changesets work, accomplishing similar goals as semantic-release where we want to tell the packages how to automatically bump their semver ranges.At times we'd get to 40k of them in a single folder, which we found out causes a large tree object to be created every time you add a new file into that folder.So, lesson #1 we learned was...Don't keep thousands of things in a single folder.We ended up implementing two things to help here. One was a pull request into beachball which did several changes in a single change file instead of one per package.Second, we wrote a pipeline which runs and automatically cleans up that change folder periodically to stop it from getting so large.Huzzah! We fixed git bloat!Lesson #2we fixed git bloat! no we didn'tOur versioning flow at scale maintains a mirror of main called versioned which stores the actual versions of packages so we can keep main free of git conflicts, and have an accurate view of which git commits correspond to which semver versions we release via NPM packages. (this needs another blog post, but I digress...)I noticed that the versioned branch seeming to get harder and harder to clone because it kept getting so huge. But, we'd dealt with the change file issue, and the only thing going in that versioned branch in terms of commits was appends to CHANGELOG.md and CHANGELOG.json files.batman scratching his chinTime passed on, and our repo, while growing slightly slower, still grew and grew. However, it was sort of difficult to know whether this growth was now due to simply scale, or something else altogether. We were adding hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and hundreds of developers every year since 2021, so a case was to be made that natural growth was occurring. However, once we came to realize that we had surpassed the growth rate of the one of the biggest monorepos at Microsoft, the Office one, we realized, something else must be wrong!That's when we called for backup...The author of such git features as git shallow checkout, git sparse index, and all kinds of other features created because of the size of our monorepos in Office, had just re-joined our organization after a stint at Github bringing those features to the world.He took a look, and immediately realized something was definitely not right with this growth rate. When we pulled our versioned branches, those branches that only change CHANGELOG.md and CHANGELOG.json, we were fetching 125GB of extra git data?! HOW THO??Welp, after some super deep git digging, it turned out that some old packing code checked in by Linux Torvalds (ever heard of him \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f) was actually only checking the last 16 characters of a filename when it gets ready to do compression of a file before it pushes the diffs. For context, usually git just pushes the diffs of changed files, however, because of this packing issue, git was comparing CHANGELOG.md files from two different packages! Stolee explains this well in here.For example, if you changed repo/packages/foo/CHANGELOG.json, when git was getting ready to do the push, it was generating a diff against repo/packages/bar/CHANGELOG.json! This meant we were in many occasions just pushing the entire file again and again, which could be 10s of MBs per file in some cases, and you can imagine in a repo our size, how that would be a problem.We were then able to try repacking our repo with a larger window git repack -adf --window=250 to have git do a better job compressing the pack files for our repo to reduce the size. This did definitely reduce the size of the repo significantly, however, we can do even better! This PR https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/5171 added a new way to pack the repo based upon walking git paths as opposed to the default of walking commits.The results are staggering...I ran a new git clone on my machine yesterday to try the new version of git in Microsoft's git fork (git version 2.47.0.vfs.0.2)...And after running the new git repack -adf --path-walk ...Crazy. It went from 178GB to 5GB. \ud83d\ude31The other new configuration option being added will further ensure that the right types of deltas are generated at git push time...git config --global pack.usePathWalk true That will make sure your git push commands are performing the correct compression.Any developer on the git version 2.47.0.vfs.0.2 can now repack the repo once cloned locally, as well as use the new git push path walk algorithm to stop the growth rate.On Github, re-packing and git garbage collection happens periodically, but again, the type of packing which Github does will not correctly compute",

So, we have some databases on PostgreSQL 14 (yes, I know, we should upgrade, but it is LONG project to upgrade, so it's not really on the table now). Last week someone noticed problems with website. These were tracked to queries getting killed because of statement_timeout of 3 minutes. The query was relatively simple (most of the identifiers were obfuscated, but tried to keep them somewhat memorable): SELECT MAX( voluntaries.cached_due_date ) FROM changes51_gauge_8273.voluntaries WHERE voluntaries.mutilation_id = 12122656 AND voluntaries.workflow_state <> 'deleted'; Interesting thing was that on primary db the query returned in couple of milliseconds, but on replica it got killed after 3 minutes. Repeatably. First thing that I did was run explain on the query.

Interesting columns, and indexes look like this: COLUMN \u2502 TYPE \u2502 Collation \u2502 NULLABLE \u2502 DEFAULT \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u256a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u256a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u256a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u256a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 mutilation_id \u2502 BIGINT \u2502 \u2502 NOT NULL \u2502 workflow_state \u2502 CHARACTER VARYING(255) \u2502 \u2502 NOT NULL \u2502 cached_due_date \u2502 TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME zone \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 Indexes: \"index_active_voluntaries\" btree (mutilation_id, workman_exhale_id) WHERE workflow_state::text <> 'deleted'::text \"index_voluntaries_on_mutilation_id_and_automation_type\" btree (mutilation_id, automation_type) \"index_voluntaries_on_mutilation_id_and_user_id\" btree (mutilation_id, user_id) \"index_voluntaries_on_cached_due_date\" btree (cached_due_date) At the moment, I don't recall which index was used on primary, but I think it was index_active_voluntaries. Let's think about what has happened. On primary, where everything was fast, Pg decided to use index to filter based on mutilation_id and workflow_state, and then it got max value of cached_due_date by simply reading the value from all rows that matched mutilation_id/workflow_state combo. But on secondary, it decided to scan data based on order of cached_due_date and stop on first found row that matches mutilation_id/workflow_state. The problem with this is, that if rows that match the mutilation_id/workflow_state are relatively rare (or don't exist) \u2013 PostgreSQL will have to read the whole table (230GB) in random order (well, based on cached_due_date) to find first row with appropriate mutilation_id/workflow_state. If you don't understand it \u2013 consider phone book of millions of people, sorted by \u201cfirstname\". In such phone if I'd like to find \u201cmax(lastname)\" for \u201cfirstname = \u2018hubert'\" \u2013 it will be fast. Index scan to find hubert, and then find max lastname. Trivial. But what if the phone book is sorted by \u201clastname\"? Well, if person with lastname \u201czzzzzzzz\" happened to have \u201chubert\" as firstname, it would be trivial. We scan backward the book, and find first hubert. But what will happen if there is only \u201chubert abc\"? Finding it by scanning the book from zzz will take VERY LONG TIME. This is what happened. So, what can we do about it? First idea was to run ANALYZE. We did, it didn't help. Which, in hind sight wasn't surprising \u2013 primary had the same stats, and was picking different index. Given this we had to find another way. There were actually two ways to fix the query: change the query so that pg will have to find rows with the mutilation_id/workflow_state combo that we want, and only then look for max cached_due_date. And another idea: add specialized index. First approach, forcing Pg to pick what we need is trivial thanks to MATERIALIZED clause of common table expression. Rewrote the query to: =$ WITH x AS MATERIALIZED ( SELECT voluntaries.cached_due_date FROM changes51_gauge_8273.voluntaries WHERE voluntaries.mutilation_id = 12122656 AND voluntaries.workflow_state <> 'deleted' ) SELECT MAX( cached_due_date ) FROM x; Unfortunately in the heat of the moment, with broken-ish site, I didn't think about saving the explain analyze plan from this. But it generally ran in ~ 5ms, if my memory serves. Of course if there were millions of rows that match the mutilation_id/workflow_state condition, it would take longer, as it would have to scan more rows to find the one with max(cached_due_date). 5ms isn't bad, but the problem with handling many rows caused me to look into better index. Luckily this is rather simple. Our query had one interesting condition using = operator, one condition that is using <>, which can be used as where clause for index, and one more column used for sorting/getting max. This means that index should be: =$ CREATE INDEX depesz_bandaid ON changes51_gauge_8273.voluntaries (mutilation_id, cached_due_date) WHERE workflow_state <> 'deleted'; Making this index took a while (after all, it had to read data from the whole table). But with this index, old query was running in: QUERY PLAN \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 Result (cost=0.62..0.63 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.014..0.015 rows=1 loops=1) InitPlan 1 (returns $0) -> Limit (cost=0.58..0.62 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.013..0.013 rows=0 loops=1) -> Index Only Scan Backward using depesz_bandaid on voluntaries (cost=0.58..154.95 rows=3311 width=8) (actual time=0.012..0.012 rows=0 loops=1) Index Cond: ((mutilation_id = 12122656) AND (cached_due_date IS NOT NULL)) Heap Fetches: 0 Planning Time: 0.321 ms Execution Time: 0.028 ms (8 rows) And the new query, with MATERIALIZED was even slightly faster: QUERY PLAN \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 Aggregate (cost=1024.69..1024.70 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.051..0.052 rows=1 loops=1) CTE x -> Index Only Scan using depesz_bandaid on voluntaries (cost=0.58..676.60 rows=15471 width=8) (actual time=0.015..0.032 rows=55 loops=1) Index Cond: (mutilation_id = 12122656) Heap Fetches: 55 -> CTE Scan on x (cost=0.00..309.42 rows=15471 width=8) (actual time=0.016..0.045 rows=55 loops=1) Planning Time: 0.193 ms Execution Time: 0.070 ms (8 rows) I'm actually kinda surprised that the materialized query seemed to be faster, would have expected it to be slightly slower, but both approached, with the new index, are good enough.

Is it OK to configure multiple second factors?Since I have a degree in Information Security \ud83e\udd13, I think I\u2019ll try to clarify these questions by describing the underlying theory, so you\u2019ll have a decision framework to make educated choices.\ud83d\udd17The Two Pillars of SecurityThe purpose of authentication is simple: verify that the user is the one who they are claiming to be. So, how do we do this? In general, there are two ways:Check that the user knows some secret (password, key phrase, pin code)Check that the user has something unique (key card, specific device, physical features)These two categories are fundamentally different. Knowledge cannot be easily transferred without the user knowing it, but the user can share it on purpose without organization\u2019s acknowledgement. Possessions cannot be accessed remotely and are designed not to be copied easily.That\u2019s why requiring both is a very good idea. It\u2019s called two-factor authentication or 2FA.Note that requiring two passwords is NOT 2FA, at the \u201cfactor\u201d is the same for both passwords: knowledge. If one password is leaked, the chances are the second one was leaked together with it through the same channel. That\u2019s why no sane security system would ask you for two passwords.\ud83d\udd17ConvertiblesAn interesting property of these factors is that they can be converted between one another.A password can be written down on a piece paper, thus becoming a possession factor. The paper can then be put into a safe, thus becoming a 2FA secret: you need to know the lock code AND have physical access to the safe.Or a TOTP key can be put in a password manager. If the password manager is protected only by a password, the secret becomes knowledge-based.One other dangerous pattern that I saw (and used, I\u2019m no saint here) is the overuse of biometric authentication on your mobile phone. If you use a fingerprint to unlock your phone and then the fingerprint to unlock your password manager, welp, all your secrets were effectively converted to 1FA.\ud83d\udd17Local password managersSo, how do password managers fit into this? Let\u2019s consider KeePassXC or any other local password manager.If you put a password behind another password or pass phrase, it remains a knowledge-based secret. However, reading it also requires access to the encrypted file. If the file is stored only on your local disk, it\u2019s 2FA, congratulations!Note, that the end system protection remains 1FA of course, to crack it you only need to brute-force one password. But at least on your system that information is stored safely.The security improvement comes from the fact that you don\u2019t have to remember the password from 3rd party services anymore, you can generate them extremely long and store safely behind 2FA as described above. However, there\u2019s no way a password manager can turn 1FA into 2FA.\ud83d\udd17Password manager as a serviceIf you\u2019re using a remote password manager (Bitwarden, LastPass, 1Password, etc), the situation is slightly different. By default, they will ask you to set only the master password. And since the vault can be accessed from anywhere, it turns all your security into 1FA.Follow me: you have for example a Proton Mail account (which I highly recommend that you do). You\u2019ve configured 2FA there, but you\u2019ve put both your password and TOTP into Bitwarden. If Bitwarden is protected only by the master password (no TOTP), it makes your Proton account secured only with one factor.OK, what if you have 2FA configured for the password manager? Well, let\u2019s break this down:If your Proton account is secured only with one factor, it doesn\u2019t improve anything (apart from being able to generate a really complex password as mentioned in the previous section)If it has 2FA, then it remains 2FAHowever, in any case the attack surface is bigger now: a hacker can either hack your password manager or your Proton account. And password manager becomes a prime target for attackers, as it gives access to everything you have online. On one hand, a good password manager service is audited and should be secure. On the other hand, again, the attack surface is ENORMOUS:Backend servicesTheir internal databaseAll their infraCI/CD pipelinesBrowser extensionsExtension storeAll the upstream libraries (a.k.a supply chain)Communication between all of the aboveShould you stop using password managers? No, absolutely not! But, in my opinion, storing TOTPs there is a malicious functionality, and should not be used for anything critical. Putting all your identities in one place is very convenient, but the stakes are too high. Divide and conquer!\ud83d\udd17RecoveringThere\u2019s always a compromise between security and usability. But there\u2019s a third factor, which is often overlooked until it\u2019s too late: recoverability.Imagine you\u2019re in a different country for a business trip and your luggage got lost together with your laptop, and you have only your phone. Will you still be able to access your data? What if the phone is stolen too? What if you have amnesia and you\u2019ve forgotten all your passwords?Do you sense how it goes into the opposite direction of \u201calways have two factors, period\u201d?It\u2019s up for you to decide from which scenarios you want to protect yourself, but as the absolute minimum your security system should survive the loss of at least one device.\ud83d\udd17My setupSince I don\u2019t believe in security by obscurity, here\u2019s my setup:I have Nextcloud. I consider it a secure storage. It is protected with 2FA:The password is very complex, stored in a KeePassXCTOTP is stored on my phone in the Aegis app, unlocked by biometryBoth KeePassXC and Aegis is backed up (with encryption) in the same Nextcloud, thus creating a secure loop: to access Nextcloud you need access to Nextcloud.Nextcloud data is synced between multiple devices, so loosing one of them:doesn\u2019t lock me out of the system: I still have access to other devicesdoesn\u2019t compromise my security: My devices and backups are encrypted with different keysSo, to my analysis, I\u2019m not downgrading 2FA to 1FA at",
